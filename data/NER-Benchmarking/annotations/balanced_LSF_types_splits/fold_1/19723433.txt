Toothpaste use by children, oral hygiene, and nutritional education: an assessment of parental performance. 
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine oral health habits and educational needs of children as reported by their parents or guardians attending a health fair in West Virginia. METHODS: Parents and/or guardians completed a questionnaire about the oral hygiene care, food and beverage consumption of their children. They also demonstrated the amount of toothpaste applied to their children's toothbrush. Toothpaste samples were then weighed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven parents or guardians participated. An average of 0.53 mg of toothpaste was dispensed per brushing, almost double the recommended amount. Most of the parents or guardians (75%) indicated their children had brushed twice the day prior to completing the questionnaire. Only 21% reported that their children's teeth had been flossed. Most children had a limited soda, sweet drinks, and fruit juice intake. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were apparently knowledgeable about prevention, the need to limit sugary beverages, and the importance of brushing twice a day. They were not as knowledgeable about the need for flossing, providing fruits and vegetables to their children, the significance of not skipping a meal, or the appropriate amount of toothpaste use.
