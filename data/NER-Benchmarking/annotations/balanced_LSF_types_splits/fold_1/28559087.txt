Not only limbs in atypical restless legs syndrome. 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) typically affects the limbs, but the involvement of other body parts has also been reported. In this essay, we critically review all literature reports of atypical RLS cases with unusual localizations. Applying the updated diagnostic criteria of the International restless legs syndrome study group (IRLSSG), which also consider symptoms localized outside of the lower limbs, a few of these atypical cases reported in the previous literature resulted in a definitive diagnosis of RLS. We also discuss the relationship between RLS and burning mouth syndrome (BMS) or restless genital syndrome (RGS). We conclude clinical sleep specialists should be aware of unusual RLS localizations because they respond to the usual treatment for RLS. All the IRLSSG diagnostic criteria should be applied in every suspected case, in order to establish a correct diagnosis of this disabling but treatable condition.
