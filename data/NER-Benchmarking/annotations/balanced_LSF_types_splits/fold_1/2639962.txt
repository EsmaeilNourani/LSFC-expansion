Continuing education. 
A large, representative sample of licensed dental hygienists practicing in the United States was surveyed by ADHA regarding dental hygiene demographics, office characteristics, supervision and practice behavior, infection control practices, utilization of medical and dental histories, and continuing education. This paper presents the continuing education portion of this survey and specifically explores relationships among descriptive variables such as dental hygienists' ages, types of practice, membership in ADHA, continuing education courses attended, and interest versus need in continuing education course attendance. Results indicate that continuing education participation is most likely for dental hygienists under 25 years of age and who are working over 30 hours per week in a speciality office which employs seven or more staff members. Comparisons among dentist, dental hygienist, and dental assistant participation were made for selected continuing education topics. According to the respondents, more dental hygienists than dentists or dental assistants have participated in continuing education courses on blood pressure measurement, aseptic technique, AIDs, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Dental hygienists perceived a need for attendance by all dental personnel in selected continuing education programs.
