Research on electroencephalogram to measure thermal pleasure in thermal alliesthesia in temperature step-change environment. 
Thermal pleasure is currently measured along psychological and physiological variables. However, in transient environments where temperatures change, it is hard to correlate psychological and physiological measures, because there is a delay in physiological changes. This study tests a method for correlating both measures using electroencephalogram (EEG), which can capture physiological feedback with a rapid response rate. In this experimental study, thermal pleasure was induced in a temperature step-change environment, one of non-uniform and transient environments. During the experiment, EEG was monitored and psychological responses of thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes were collected via survey questionnaire. A total of 50 males in their twenties participated in a climate chamber experiment. An experimental group of 25 men were exposed to temperature step-change between two different room conditions (32degreesC, 65% and 25degreesC, 50%), experiencing thermal pleasure. The control group of the remaining 25 men were exposed to an unchanging condition, experiencing thermal comfort close to thermal neutrality. The EEG spectral analysis demonstrated that EEG frequency band associated with pleasant emotional (theta) increased while frequency band related to pleasantness, satisfaction or relaxation (beta) decreased with thermal pleasure.
