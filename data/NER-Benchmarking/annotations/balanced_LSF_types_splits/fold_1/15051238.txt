Contribution of (222)Rn-bearing water to the occupational exposure in thermal baths. 
The present study investigates the short- and long-term effects of radon ((222)Rn) released from water on the progeny exposure in a thermal spa. For the purposes of this work, the Polichnitos spa was used as a case study. The bathroom was supplied with water containing 110-210 kBq m(-3) of (222)Rn. The (222)Rn concentration in air and the short-lived (222)Rn progenies in attached and unattached form were monitored into the bathroom and the surrounding premises. The equilibrium factor (F-factor) and the unattached fraction were estimated. The results of this study show that water flow during bath filling is by far the dominant mechanism by which (222)Rn is released in the air of the bathroom. The progeny exposure was correlated linearly with the (222)Rn concentration in the entering water. The annual effective dose received by a worker was found to be below the lower limit value of 3 mSv recommended by ICRP 65. The dose limit was exceeded only for water containing more than 300 kBq m(-3).
