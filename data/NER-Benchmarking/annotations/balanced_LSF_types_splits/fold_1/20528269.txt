Predicting the determinants of users' intentions for using YouTube to share video: moderating gender effects. 
This research aims to improve understanding of what motivates individual online users to share their videos on YouTube and whether gender affects those motivations. The work proposes a model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and social influences theory by conducting a survey of 206 male and 135 female video sharers of YouTube to test this model. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is an important determinant of the intention to use YouTube to share video. All factors from the social influence perspective significantly affect the intention to use YouTube to share video. The results show that differences exist in sharing behavior between female and male users. Female users' intention is strongly influenced by usefulness and social norms, while male users' intention is strongly influenced by interpersonal norms. Based on those findings, implications for theory and practice are discussed.
