Multiheaded mandibular condyles. 
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of multiheaded condyles (MHC) in a group of Turkish subjects using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). METHODS: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans of 975 patients (546 female, 429 male; age 15-89 years, mean age 42.46 years) who were referred to Istanbul University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Dentomaxillofacial Radiology between 2015 and 2021 were evaluated. Bifid and trifid mandibular condyle cases were analyzed according to the patients' age, gender, and laterality, and their frequencies were determined statistically. RESULTS: A multiheaded mandibular condyle (MHC) was detected in 57 of the 975 patients (546 female, 429 male). MHC was diagnosed unilaterally in 49 patients; in 8 patients, it was observed bilaterally. A bifid mandibular condyle (BMC) was detected in 54 patients. A trifid mandibular condyle (TMC) was found in 2 women, and one tetrafid mandibular condyle was seen in 1 woman. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MHC was 5.84% in our proband, which is higher than in previous studies. There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of MHC in males or females.
