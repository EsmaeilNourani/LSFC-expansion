Food, water and ethanol consumption by rats under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. 
Rats could lever press 24 hours a day for 97 mg food pellets under a fixed-interval (FI) 90 second schedule. During the first 4 days, an ethanol solution was the only available fluid, after which both water and ethanol solutions were available. At ethanol concentrations (w/v) of 5%, 7.5% and l0%, total caloric intake and total fluid intake remained constant, while ethanol consumption was inversely proportional to the concentration of the solution. When the FI 90s schedule was changed to FI 45 s, or to FI 180 s, there were only small changes in total caloric intake, total fluid intake and in percentages of total fluid consumption and total caloric intake as ethanol. The data suggest that the intake of ethanol under this fixed-interval schedule depends more on the ethanol concentration than on the calories obtained from ethanol drinking.
