Implementation of napping in industry and the problem of sleep inertia. 
It seems reasonable to believe that in specific situations napping at the work place would be possible and used if authorized and encouraged. Very short naps could have very positive long-term effects on biological functions. Training someone to sleep for short periods appears feasible if there is a high motivation to do so. Sleep inertia can be considered as one of the main limiting factors in napping strategy. Sleep inertia depends on different factors such as sleep stage preceding the awakening, temporal placement of the nap, duration of nap and wakefulness preceding it, etc. The effects of sleep inertia might be different depending on the type of task, and a reactivation technique applied immediately after awakening may remove it. Despite the fact that its implementation in industry raises some practical issues, napping can be considered as a possible strategy to increase the vigilance level of night workers.
