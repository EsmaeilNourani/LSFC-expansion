Smile aesthetics and malocclusion in UK teenage magazines assessed using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). 
OBJECTIVE: There is a significant demand for orthodontic treatment within the UK from adolescent girls, a group known to be influenced by the media portrayal of body form and body image, which may extend to the presentation of malocclusions. This study examined the portrayal of malocclusion in a media type that targets teenage girls under 16 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative selection of 1 month's magazines targeting this group were investigated, and the frequency and severity of malocclusions displayed were assessed. Two calibrated examiners viewed all the smiles (on two occasions) using a modification of Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) and assigned an Aesthetic Component Score to each smile. RESULTS: It was found that the aesthetic score is low (less than 7) for the majority of models (92.8%) indicating no need or a borderline need for treatment. Only 7.2% of models exhibited a definite need for treatment. CONCLUSION: It appears that the portrayal of malocclusion in teenage magazines does not reflect the general treatment need of the adolescent population.
