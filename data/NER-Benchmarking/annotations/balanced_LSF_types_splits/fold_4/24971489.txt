Extended regimens of combined hormonal contraception to reduce symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding and the hormone-free interval: a systematic review of randomised and observational studies. 
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether continuous and extended regimens (CRs/ERs) of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) improve symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval and to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost of CRs/ERs to those of conventional 28-day regimens. STUDY DESIGN: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies published in any language between 2006 and 2013. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs and 14 observational studies evaluated issues related to our objectives. CRs/ERs, whose efficacy and safety were comparable to those described for conventional regimens, were preferred due to their improvement of symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval and the lower costs resulting from the reduced incidence of these symptoms. CONCLUSION: The contraceptive efficacy and safety of CR/ER use of CHCs is at least equal to that of 28-days conventional regimens, and this use may have some cost savings. CRs/ERs are recommended for women willing to take a CHC for treatment of symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval.
