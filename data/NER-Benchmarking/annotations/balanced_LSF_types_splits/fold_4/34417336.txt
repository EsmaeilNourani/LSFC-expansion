Strategic and contested use of food laws to ban smokeless tobacco products in India: a qualitative analysis of litigation. 
OBJECTIVE: To understand how food laws are used, contested and interpreted to ban certain forms of chewing tobacco in India. METHODS: A qualitative study analysing all the tobacco-related litigation under the food laws in India. We used an inductive thematic analysis of the litigation contents. RESULTS: The tobacco industry systematically deployed litigation to (1) challenge the categorisation of smokeless tobacco products as food, and hence, questioned the use of food laws for regulating these products; (2) challenge the regulatory power of the state government in banning tobacco products via the food laws; and (3) challenge the applicability of the general food laws that enabled stricter regulations beyond what is prescribed under the tobacco-specific law. CONCLUSION: Despite facing several legal challenges from the tobacco industry, Indian states optimised food laws to enable stricter regulations on smokeless tobacco products than were feasible through use of a tobacco-specific law.
