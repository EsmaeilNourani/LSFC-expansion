Factors associated with exercise counseling and program preferences among breast cancer survivors. 
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess differences in exercise counseling preferences, program preferences, and telephone/Internet access among breast cancer survivors based on exercise behavior and demographic, medical, social cognitive, and environmental factors. METHODS: A self-administered survey was returned by 192 breast cancer survivors. RESULTS: Participants were Caucasian (98%), and the mean age was 64+/-11.5 years. Participants preferring an exercise specialist were more likely to report current treatment, higher self-efficacy, greater perceived barriers, and a residential environment conducive to physical activity. Participants preferring face-to-face counseling and exercising outdoors were younger, and those preferring to exercise alone and at home reported lower social support. Low-intensity exercise was preferred by participants who were sedentary, obese, less self-efficacious, enjoyed exercise less, perceived greater barriers, and reported lower social support. Participants with Internet access were more apt to be younger with higher income and greater social support. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, medical, social cognitive, and environmental factors might influence exercise preferences and Internet access. Future research assessing the effectiveness of tailoring interventions based on these factors is warranted.
