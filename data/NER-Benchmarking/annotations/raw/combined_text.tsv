Clothing and thermoregulation during exercise. 
Exercise increases heat production. During exercise in both warm and cold conditions, the major dilemma is the dissipation of the heat produced from muscular activity. The use of clothing generally represents a layer of insulation and as such imposes a barrier to heat transfer and evaporation from the skin surface. In warm environments, additional clothing increases thermal insulation causing more rapid increases in temperature during exercise and imposes a barrier to sweat evaporation. However, clothing can serve a protective function by reducing radiant heat gain and thermal stress. Recent research suggests that neither the inclusion of modest amounts of clothing nor the clothing fabric alter thermoregulation or thermal comfort during exercise in warm conditions. In the cold, most reports do not support an effect of clothing fabric on thermoregulation; however, there are reports demonstrating an effect. Clothing construction does alter thermoregulation during and following exercise in the cold, where fishnet construction offers greater heat dissipation. Future research should include conditions that more closely mimic outdoor conditions, where high work rates, large airflow and high relative humidity can significantly impact thermoregulation. 

Glycemic index of grain amaranth, wheat and rice in NIDDM subjects. 
Glycemic index of grain amaranth, wheat and rice preparations was studied in non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects. Diets containing 50 g carbohydrate equivalent were given and post-prandial blood glucose estimated at different intervals. Glycemic index calculated for different experimental diets showed that GI of amaranth-wheat composite flour diet (25:75) was the least (65.6%) followed by wheat diet (65.7%), rice diet (69.2%), amaranth-wheat flour 50:50 (75.5%), and popped amaranth in milk (97.3%). Therefore 25:75 combination of amaranth and wheat, wheat and rice can be considered low GI food, 50:50 grain amaranth and wheat medium GI food and popped amaranth and milk combination high GI food. 

The effect of antioxidant vitamins E and C on cognitive performance of the elderly with mild cognitive impairment in Isfahan, Iran: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 
PURPOSE: This study was carried out to investigate the effect of vitamins E and C on cognitive performance among the elderly in Iran. METHODS: About 256 elderly with mild cognitive impairment, aged 60-75 years, received 300 mg of vitamin E plus 400 mg of vitamin C or placebo daily just for 1 year. BACKGROUND: Demographic characteristics, anthropometric variables food consumption, cognitive function by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and some of the oxidative stress biomarkers were examined. RESULTS: Antioxidant supplementation reduced malondialdehyde level (P < 0.001) and raised total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.001) and glutathione (P < 0.01). The serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine remained unchanged (P < 0.4). After adjusting for the covariates effects, MMSE scores following 6- (25.88 +/- 0.17) and 12-month antioxidant supplementation (26.8 +/- 0.17) did not differ from control group (25.86 +/- 0.18 and 26.59 +/- 0.18, respectively). CONCLUSION: Despite significant improvement in most of the oxidative stress biomarkers, antioxidants' supplementation was not observed to enhance cognitive performance. A large number of kinetic and/or dynamic factors could be suspected. 

Evaluating national and subnational CO2 mitigation goals in China's thirteenth five-year plan from satellite observations. 
Good-quality emission data are essential to validate national climate commitments and implement domestic policies. However, conventional bottom-up data collection is costly and subject to potential manipulation by stakeholders when data pass through their hands, which could pose challenges on the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance monitoring especially in developing countries. Satellite observations, specifically OCO-2 XCO2 measurements, are utilized in this study to develop a relatively independent and timely dataset for screening the attainment statuses of national and subnational CO2 mitigation goals in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2016-2020). We establish CO2 emission estimation models at both pixel and provincial levels. As interpolated with the pixel-level model, CO2 emissions of prefecture-level municipalities indicate that approximately three fifth of them had accomplished their individualized FYP mitigation goals by 2019, while our provincial-level estimation suggests that three quarters of provinces had attained theirs. More resources for compliance monitoring could thus be directed to other presumably-unattaining local governments. National aggregate absolute emissions showed 8.0-18.3% reduction in 2019 across three provincial models from the 2015 level, while national CO2 intensity dropped by 28.8-36.8% to imply attaining the 18% reduction goals. 

Responsible Gambling Research and Industry Funding Biases. 
This brief report examines whether there are differences in aspects of different characteristics, including design/methodologies of responsible gambling (RG), between studies funded by industry as compared to other sources. To investigate this, the authors used those studies included in a recent meta-analysis focusing on the empirical basis of RG initiatives (Ladouceur et al. in Addict Res Theory 25:225-235, 2017). We examined eight associations between funding sources, and different design/methodological characteristics of these studies; type of strategy, inclusion of comparison groups, measurement scales and repeated measures, publication source, number of inclusion criteria met, secondary sources of funding, publication year. The results revealed no statistically significant difference between the funding source, and the index study characteristics. These results do not support claims that funding exerts influence on the design or methodologies of RG studies. However, the absence of statistically significant findings should not be used to assert the absence of a funding effect because there are many reasons for failing to find differences, or interpretation of findings. Unexpectedly, a third of the papers included in this study failed to disclose their funding sources. This finding highlights the need for more open and transparent disclosures. 

An Exploratory Analysis of Adherence Patterns and Program Completion of a Pedometer-Based Physical Activity Intervention. 
BACKGROUND: We examined participant characteristics related to pedometer program adherence and completion. METHODS: Participants (n = 177, age = 43 +/- 9 y, BMI = 29.5 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2)) were from sedentary workplaces. Baseline steps/day for women (n = 153) was 7230 +/- 3447 versus men (n = 24) 8265 +/- 2849 (P < 0.05). Records included pedometer use, days/week goals were achieved, and steps/day. Program completers (n = 104) fulfilled pre- and post-program assessments and at least 8 wk of recording. Non-completers (n = 53) met neither requirement, but pre-program data were available. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, education, or time at work between completion strata. The only significant baseline difference was an initial "worry about completing the program" (completer < non-completer; P < 0.05). The pedometer-based program was most successful in increasing physical activity in overweight or class I obese individuals. Participants with lower baseline steps/day were also more likely to complete the program. CONCLUSION: The study findings have potential to inform effective health promotion planning. 

Orthodontic and orthognathic management of a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta: a case report. 
This case report describes a patient's severe Class III malocclusion, managed with a combination of orthodontic and orthognathic treatment. The medical history was complicated by osteogenesis imperfecta and dentinogenesis imperfecta. In addition the patient was a Jehovah's Witness. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta carry an increased risk of perioperative haemorrhage, and this led to bimaxillary surgery being carried out as two discrete surgical episodes for the patient described. In addition, the risk of enamel fracture led to orthodontic bands being cemented on all teeth. In spite of the increased risks a successful outcome was achieved. 

Factors associated with exercise counseling and program preferences among breast cancer survivors. 
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess differences in exercise counseling preferences, program preferences, and telephone/Internet access among breast cancer survivors based on exercise behavior and demographic, medical, social cognitive, and environmental factors. METHODS: A self-administered survey was returned by 192 breast cancer survivors. RESULTS: Participants were Caucasian (98%), and the mean age was 64+/-11.5 years. Participants preferring an exercise specialist were more likely to report current treatment, higher self-efficacy, greater perceived barriers, and a residential environment conducive to physical activity. Participants preferring face-to-face counseling and exercising outdoors were younger, and those preferring to exercise alone and at home reported lower social support. Low-intensity exercise was preferred by participants who were sedentary, obese, less self-efficacious, enjoyed exercise less, perceived greater barriers, and reported lower social support. Participants with Internet access were more apt to be younger with higher income and greater social support. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, medical, social cognitive, and environmental factors might influence exercise preferences and Internet access. Future research assessing the effectiveness of tailoring interventions based on these factors is warranted. 

Group therapy module to enhance self-esteem in patients with borderline personality disorder: a pilot study. 
Psychotherapeutic treatments of borderline personality disorder (BPD) often focus on severe behavioral problems. Until now, few techniques have been developed to specifically address low self-esteem in BPD. We developed a 6-session psychoeducative group therapy module to treat low self-esteem in BPD patients. After developing and piloting the therapy module, a controlled outpatient pilot study was performed. Nineteen female BPD patients participated in the group module after discharge from an inpatient DBT program. Twenty-four female BPD patients served as controls. Outcome was assessed by different self-esteem measures. Results showed a greater improvement in self-esteem in the intervention group. The findings suggest that the therapy module is an effective adjunctive treatment in increasing self-esteem in BPD. 

Integrating psychology and medicine in CPAP adherence--new concepts? 
To date, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective intervention in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea, but adherence to this treatment is often less than optimal. A variety of factors and interventions that influence and improve CPAP use have been examined. There is increasing recognition of the multifaceted nature of CPAP adherence: the patient's psychological profile and social environment have been recognised, in addition to the more extensively researched patient's treatment and physiological profile. Understanding how these multiple factors impact on CPAP use in an integrative fashion might provide us with a useful holistic model of CPAP adherence. This concept of integration--a biopsychosocial (BPS) approach to health and illness--has previously been described to understand care provision for various chronic health disorders. This paper proposes an adherence framework, whereby variables integrally affect CPAP use. The BPS model has been considered for nearly 35 years; the presence of poor CPAP adherence was acknowledged in the early 1990s--it is timely to incorporate this approach into our care pathway of CPAP users. 

Depressive symptoms among female college students experiencing gender-based violence in Awassa, Ethiopia. 
Little epidemiologic research has focused on the mental health effects of gender-based violence among sub-Saharan African women. The objective of this study was to assess risk of depression and depressive symptoms among 1,102 female undergraduate students who were victims of gender-based violence. Students who reported experience of any gender-based violence were nearly twice as likely to be classified as having moderate depression during the academic year (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.39-2.82) as compared with nonabused students. Compared with nonabused students, those who had experienced both physical and sexual abuse were 4 times more likely to report either moderately severe (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 2.00-9.31) or severe depressive symptoms (OR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.01-17.43). Our findings, consistent with previous studies, support the thesis that women's mental health status is adversely affected by exposure to gender-based violence. 

Organoarsenicals in poultry litter: detection, fate, and toxicity. 
Arsenic contamination in groundwater has endangered the health and safety of millions of people around the world. One less studied mechanism for arsenic introduction into the environment is the use of organoarsenicals in animal feed. Four organoarsenicals are commonly employed as feed additives: arsanilic acid, carbarsone, nitarsone, and roxarsone. Organoarsenicals are composed of a phenylarsonic acid molecule with substituted functional groups. This review documents the use of organoarsenicals in the poultry industry, reports analytical methods available for quantifying organic arsenic, discusses the fate and transport of organoarsenicals in environmental systems, and identifies toxicological concerns associated with these chemicals. In reviewing the literature on organoarsenicals, several research needs were highlighted: advanced analytical instrumentation that allows for identification and quantification of organoarsenical degradation products; a greater research emphasis on arsanilic acid, carbarsone, and nitarsone; identification of degradation pathways, products, and kinetics; and testing/development of agricultural wastewater and solid treatment technologies for organoarsenical-laden waste. 

"Experience-sharing" as an antidote to dependence-making behavior of general practitioners. 
This article explores how group-dynamic interventions can be used to teach health professionals to counter impulses to make clients dependent on them. The basic assumption, derived from Kohut's work on narcissism, is that dependence-making behavior is connected with deep-rooted feelings of insufficiency resulting from a defective autonomy. A part of the standard Dutch General Practice (GP) training program, experience-sharing in groups of 12 GP trainees, offers opportunities to explore these feelings. The format of this experience-sharing (well-defined boundaries, minimal structure, facilitating leaders) often evokes behavior in which the peculiarities of the dependence-making behavior of the GP's vis-a-vis patients are mirrored: that is, dependent behavior. In order to analyze and influence this behavior, use can be made of Levine's model of group psychotherapy, which focuses on enhancing autonomy. In this paper we show, by means of four group cases, how Levine's framework can be used to enhance autonomy, lessen dependence, and thus diminish the tendency of GP's toward dependence-making behavior. 

Jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis): nutrition related aspects and needed nutrition research. 
The nutritional characteristics and food potentials of jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) have been reviewed. The bean is a good sources of protein, 23% to 34%, and carbohydrate 55%. It is also a good source of Ca, Zn, P, Mg, Cu and Ni. Jack bean protein is adequate in most essential amino acids with the exception of methionine and cystine which may be nutritionally limiting. Antinutritional and toxic factors including trypsin inhibitors, hemagglutinins, cyanogen glucosides, oligosaccharides and others are present in jack bean. Properly processed jack bean could be used to prepare some of the popular dishes made from cowpea, peanut, pigeon pea and soybean. Industrial products such as protein concentrates and isolates, starch, flakes, grits and flours can be produced from the bean. Further research is needed to identify varieties with high protein and nutritional quality. Development of new highly nutritious food products based on whole or processed jack bean should increase production and expand use. 

Spinning a global web: tactics used by Big Tobacco to attract children at tobacco points-of-sale. 
Most of the published literature on cigarette advertising and promotion at points-of-sale is on research conducted in high-income countries. We report findings from monitoring cigarette advertising and promotion at points-of-sale near schools and playgrounds in 42 countries, the majority low-income and middle-income. Four strategies were detected across most of these countries: (1) display of cigarettes near snacks, sweets and sugary drinks, (2) placement of cigarette advertisements near the eye-level of children, (3) advertisements and display of flavoured cigarettes and (4) sale of single sticks of cigarettes. These advertising and promotional tactics target children and youth and demonstrate that multinational tobacco companies use similar strategies to promote cigarettes at points-of-sale. The widespread violations of existing laws and regulations, the exploitation of regulatory loopholes and lack of existing tobacco control policies that apply to points-of-sale call for adoption and enactment of provisions recommended by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control such as comprehensive bans on tobacco advertisement, promotion and sponsorship, bans on sale of single cigarette sticks and regulation of flavours. These strategies will help to protect children and youth from exposure to tobacco advertising. 

Toothpaste use by children, oral hygiene, and nutritional education: an assessment of parental performance. 
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine oral health habits and educational needs of children as reported by their parents or guardians attending a health fair in West Virginia. METHODS: Parents and/or guardians completed a questionnaire about the oral hygiene care, food and beverage consumption of their children. They also demonstrated the amount of toothpaste applied to their children's toothbrush. Toothpaste samples were then weighed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven parents or guardians participated. An average of 0.53 mg of toothpaste was dispensed per brushing, almost double the recommended amount. Most of the parents or guardians (75%) indicated their children had brushed twice the day prior to completing the questionnaire. Only 21% reported that their children's teeth had been flossed. Most children had a limited soda, sweet drinks, and fruit juice intake. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were apparently knowledgeable about prevention, the need to limit sugary beverages, and the importance of brushing twice a day. They were not as knowledgeable about the need for flossing, providing fruits and vegetables to their children, the significance of not skipping a meal, or the appropriate amount of toothpaste use. 

Recurrent hypersomnia: a review of 339 cases. 
Based on 339 cases this review identifies, quantifies and compares 4 clinical forms of recurrent hypersomnia (1) Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) (239 cases), (2) Kleine-Levin syndrome without compulsive eating (KLS WOCE) (54 cases), (3) Menstrual related hypersomnia (MRH) (18 cases) and Recurrent hypersomnia with comorbidity (RHC) (28 cases). A second part of the review considers the main current issues on recurrent hypersomnia: the predisposing factors, including a window on family cases; the pathophysiology based on clinical patterns, neuroimaging data, neuropathological examinations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 measurements; the issues of recurrence and of a possible disruption of the circadian timing system; the relationships between recurrent hypersomnia and mood disorders; and a note on the atypical Kleine-Levin syndrome. The main outcomes of this study are a clear nosologic distinction of the different forms of recurrent hypersomnia, the finding that the prevalence of familial cases of KLS is in the same range as in narcolepsy, the suggestion of the possible involvement of a large set of cortical and subcortical structures in recurrent hypersomnia and some clues in favour of a relationship between recurrent hypersomnia and mood disorders. 

Automated oral hygiene self-care devices: making evidence-based choices to improve client outcomes. 
Dental hygienists have historically been the primary promoters of health, prevention, and wellness in dental practice. With the large number of automated self-care devices available, many clients expect their dental hygienists to be experts and advisors on such purchases. It is vitally important for dental hygienists to understand and evaluate the available clinical research findings, and along with their clients, apply them in a collaborative decision making process. The purpose of this course is for dental hygienists to learn the scientific and practical implications of evidence-based care in the selection of automated oral hygiene self-care devices. Measurable clinical outcomes in plaque removal, reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, probing depth, periodontal pathogens, and the role of inflammatory mediators will be discussed. Automated self-care products currently available will be identified. Successful completion of the course objectives will be assessed by a post-test, to be completed by the learner after reading the article in its entirety. Two hours of continuing education course credit will be awarded following successful completion of the post test. 

Effects of sleep deprivation on wound healing. 
Sleep deprivation is widely regarded as a stressor and has been shown to have significant effects on host defences. Severely sleep-deprived rats develop lesions on their paws and tails, suggesting possible deficits in the healing process. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep deprivation (RSD) on wound healing in a rat model. Male dark-hooded Long-Evans rats, 2-4 months old, were subjected to dorsal application of two sterile punch biopsies, each 3.5 mm in size. Biopsies were performed either immediately before or immediately after 5 days of sleep deprivation. Wound healing in REM sleep-deprived animals was compared with home cage control and yoked control animals. RSD did not produce differences in the rate of healing, regardless of the timing of the biopsy punch. RSD does not appear to have significant effects on wound healing and thus appears to act differently from other types of stressors on wound healing. 

Does physical activity affect the predictive value of health-related fitness tests on walking difficulty? 
BACKGROUND: Low levels of physical activity (PA) and poor fitness tend to predict a decline in mobility. The current study investigated whether PA modifies the predictive value of health-related fitness (HRF) tests on difficulty in walking 2 km (WD). METHODS: PA was assessed by self-reported questionnaires in 1990 and 1996. Subjects age 55 to 69 years and free of self-reported WD participated in assessment of HRF in 1996. Occurrence of WD was assessed by questionnaire in 2002 (n=537). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant interactions between PA and HRF tests; thus, PA and HRF were both independent predictors of WD. Regardless of the PA level, the subjects in the poorest performing third in each HRF test had higher risk of WD than the subjects in the best performing third. CONCLUSIONS: PA and HRF seemed to be independent predictors of WD, although the association of PA with WD was weaker than the association of HRF. Thus, PA did not modify the predictive value of HRF on WD. 

Progress toward a voluntary oral consumption model of alcoholism. 
With the goal of obtaining a suitable animal model for voluntary oral consumption of ethanol, the investigators selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring and alcohol-nonpreferring rats, with preference considered as a function of the concentration of ethanol ingested. Studies with these animals showed that drinking is voluntary and not contingent on caloric restriction; that they will work to obtain ethanol even when food and water are freely available, and in so doing, show psychological or behavioral tolerance; that the amount of ethanol voluntarily consumed approaches their apparent maximum capacity for ethanol elimination. This amount of ethanol was capable of altering brain neurotransmitter content, thus exerting a CNS pharmocologic effect. In addition, the rats will bar-press for intravenous administration of ethanol, and with prolonged, free-choice consumption, ethanol intake increases to as much as 12 g per kg body weight per day without producing behavioral deficits, suggesting the development of tolerance. 

Cognitive and behavioral therapies for pathological gambling. 
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of behavioral and cognitive treatment approaches in the management of pathological gambling disorders. Disappointingly, the literature to date contains only one controlled outcome study in which two differing behavioral techniques were compared. Although research in general has focussed on identifying the nature of cognitive distortions in gambling, findings from these studies have not been systematically translated into treatment programs. It is concluded that methodological limitations including small sample size, absence of control groups, multiple concurrent interventions and poorly defined outcome criteria preclude conclusive statements to be drawn regarding the active ingredient of either behavioral or cognitive strategies. The program offered within the Impulse Disorders Research Centre is outlined. 

Factors affecting exercise attendance and completion in sedentary older adults: a meta-analytic approach. 
BACKGROUND: Many different constructs are used currently in the literature to assess exercise adherence. This study examined whether the same or different variables predict exercise attendance and exercise completion among sedentary older adults. METHODS: Thirty-seven randomized control trials were selected from articles published between 1980 and 2000 that tested exercise interventions for sedentary older adults. Block-entry, weighted, hierarchical meta-regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Different factors predicted attendance and completion. Group-based (P < .05) and resistance exercise (P < .1) predicted higher attendance rates than individual-based and aerobic exercise. In contrast, facility-based exercise was associated with higher completion rates than homebased exercise (P < .1). CONCLUSIONS: Results show that completing a program is not synonymous with good attendance. Program designers need to consider different strategies to boost both of these rates that need to be maximized to best benefit program participants. 

Reducing Anxiety and Anxiety Sensitivity With High-Intensity Interval Training in Adults With Asthma. 
BACKGROUND: Low- and moderate-intensity exercise training has been shown to be effective for reducing general anxiety and anxiety sensitivity among adults with asthma. Exercise frequency and intensity have been shown to play an integral role in reducing anxiety sensitivity; however, less is known about the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on anxiety in adults with asthma. METHODS: A 6-week HIIT intervention was conducted with adults with asthma. Participants completed HIIT (10% peak power output for 1 min, 90% peak power output for 1 min, repeated 10 times) 3 times per week on a cycle ergometer. Preintervention and postintervention assessments included the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 and the Body Sensations Questionnaire. RESULTS: Total Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (PRE: 17.9 [11.8]; POST 12.4 [13], P = .002, Cohen d = 0.4, n = 20) and Body Sensations Questionnaire (PRE: 2.4 [1.0]; POST: 2.0 [0.8], P = .007, Cohen d = 0.3) improved from preintervention to postintervention. CONCLUSION: A 6-week HIIT intervention leads to improved anxiety among adults with asthma. Future research should determine the impact of HIIT among adults with asthma with clinical anxiety. 

Effects of Manisa propolis on telomerase activity in leukemia cells obtained from the bone marrow of leukemia patients. 
Propolis is a resinous material collected by honeybees and obtained from beehives that has anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of propolis on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in the leukemia cells obtained from leukemia patients. Four different bone marrow cell cultures from each of four leukemia cases were prepared. The 60 ng/ml, 30 ng/ml and 15 ng/ml working concentrations of propolis were administered to three cultures of each patient, while one culture contained only culture medium. hTERT mRNA expression levels of cells were detected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument. A significant decrease in hTERT expression levels was observed in the 60 ng/ml concentration of propolis. In conclusion, Manisa propolis may also have a potential effect on the expression of hTERT in leukemia-particularly owing to its constituent chrysin. 

The ethical group psychotherapist: a coda. 
This concluding article of a two-part special section on the ethical group psychotherapist are highlighted: (1) the importance of the cultivation of the skill and knowledge base of the group psychotherapist in terms of pertinent legal statutes and ethical guidelines; (2) the criticalness of certain personality features related to the concept of virtue; (3) a therapist's self-awareness contributes to the capacities to think and respond ethically; (4) ethical decision making is most likely to occur when the group psychotherapist attends comprehensively to all dimensions that define the setting in which a dilemma emerges; and (5) that in the service of positive ethics, attention to the ethical dimensions of group psychotherapy practice should be continuously present. In agreement with other contributions to this section, I conclude that the commitment to the ethical practice of group psychotherapy must be made not only by the individual practitioner but also by educational and training programs and professional organizations. 

Sugar replacers and the FDA noncariogenicity claim. 
In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of a "health claim" based on the association between sugar replacers and the nonpromotion of dental caries. Small packages of products containing such sweeteners may state "Does not promote tooth decay" or "May reduce the risk of tooth decay." Larger packages must include additional information, such as "Frequent eating of foods high in sugars and starches as between-meal snacks can promote tooth decay." FDA criteria state that these products must not only be "sugar-free," but they must also contain a noncariogenic sugar replacer and not lower plaque pH below 5.7 either during consumption or up to 30 minutes after consumption when tested by in vivo pH telemetry. Many people might reduce their caries risk by using sugar-free products, and the FDA claim can help consumers identity such products. Dental hygienists are ideal sources of consumer information about sugar replacers, and can help clients distinguish between the new FDA claim and advertising claims that are not regulated by FDA. The purpose of this article is to provide dental hygienists with information on sugar replacers that will help clients make appropriate nutrition choices. 

The effects of signage and the physical environment on stair usage. 
BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a health behavior that most Americans do not participate in at recommended levels. METHODS: We sought to increase PA by use of motivational signs in selected buildings. Because physical environments are known to influence PA, the relationship of building characteristics and stair usage was also assessed. One pre- and two post-intervention observations were conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of those using the stairs increased from baseline to the second data collection, (chi2 = 39.31, p < 0.01) and baseline to a final data collection (chi2 = 10.1, p < 0.01). Built environment factors, including steps to the next higher floor and the number of floors in the building were consistent predictors of stair use. With signs positioned, the visibility of the stairs while standing in front of elevators became a significant predictor of stair usage. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational signs and characteristics of built environments are associated with increased stair usage. 

Establishing community partnerships: providing better oral health care to underserved children. 
A community partnership between a dental hygiene school and a social service program was designed to improve oral health outcomes and reduce disparities among children. This resulted in a preventive oral hygiene care project that complimented the dental hygiene program's didactic curriculum. The children received much needed oral health care and education, while the experiences enhanced dental hygiene student learning by applying the principles for planning, implementing, and evaluating dental health programs; establishing a context for understanding the prevalence of oral disease as well the disparity among population subsets; and developing a variety of clinical skills. Oral health professionals and dental hygiene programs may find this partnership a prototype of a highly productive and beneficial community health experience that could be incorporated, in part or in it's entirety, into their own community health projects. 

Sleep in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of polysomnographic findings. 
Polysomnographic studies have been conducted to explore sleep changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the relationships between sleep disturbances and PD are imperfectly understood. We conducted a systematic review of the literature exploring polysomnographic differences between PD patients and controls in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycIFNO. 67 studies were identified for systematic review, 63 of which were used for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed significant reductions in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, N2 percentage, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) percentage, and increases in wake time after sleep onset, N1 percentage, REM latency, apnea hypopnea index, and periodic limb movement index in PD patients compared with controls. There were no remarkable differences in sleep continuity or sleep architecture between PD patients with and without REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Our study suggests that PD patients have poor sleep quality and quantity. Sex, age, disease duration, presence of RBD, medication status, cognitive impairment, and adaptation night are factors that contributed to heterogeneity between studies. 

Virtual setup: application in orthodontic practice. 
BACKGROUND: A plaster dental model is a patient's traditional three-dimensional (3D) record. If the dental crowns from a plaster model are separated and positioned in wax, this setup of the crowns can be used to simulate orthodontic treatment. The traditional way to make this dental setup requires significant time by the orthodontist and in the orthodontic lab. New developments in dentistry and orthodontics include the possibility of virtual setups. AIM: In this article, the differences between conventional setups with plaster models and virtual setups are discussed. METHODS: A clinical patient is described for whom two different setups were made and compared by model superimposition with Geomagic Qualify software. RESULTS: According to the literature and the results from this study, virtual setups and conventional setups with plaster models are equally accurate. CONCLUSION: Virtual setups present several advantages, e.g., digital storage, digital models cannot be damaged, the same model can undergo several treatment simulations, and communication between dental and surgical professionals and between dental professionals and patients is facilitated. Despite these advantages, considerable time and training are needed for dental professionals to master and adopt the general use of digital models and virtual setups in dentistry. 

Effect of pomegranate (Punica granatum) juice intake on hepatic oxidative stress. 
Pomegranate juice (PJ) possesses a high antioxidant activity, which has been related to beneficial health properties. However, in vivo confirmation and characterization of these effects on biological systems are lacking and needed. This study was performed in order to investigate the effect of prolonged PJ ingestion on general oxidation status. For this purpose, mice ingested PJ (or water in control group) during four weeks, after which damage to lipids, proteins and DNA were evaluated as oxidative cell biomarkers. Levels of hepatic glutathione and the activities and expression of enzymes involved in its metabolism were determined. Catalase and SOD activities were quantified as these enzymes have a crucial role in antioxidant defence. Protection against protein and DNA oxidation was found in PJ group. There was also a significant decrease in GSH and GSSG, without change in the GSH/GSSG ratio. All studied enzymatic activities (GPx, GST, GR, SOD and catalase) were found to be decreased by PJ treatment. Additionally, RT-PCR results showed that GST and GS transcription were also decreased in this group. These results are compatible with a protective effect of PJ against systemic oxidative stress in mice. 

Understanding the Relationship Between Pet Ownership and Physical Activity Among Older Community-Dwelling Adults-A Mixed Methods Study. 
Pet ownership is associated with increased levels of physical activity (PA) in older adults. Studies have mainly focused on the association between PA and dog walking; however, broader aspects of pet ownership may influence PA. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between pet ownership and incidental and purposeful PA using a mixed methods approach. Participants' (N = 15) PA was measured for 7 days using accelerometers and diaries. Semistructured interviews explored participants' perspectives regarding pet-related activities. Participants' mean (SD) daily step count was 14,204 (5,061) steps, and mean (SD) sedentary time per day was 8.76 (1.18) hr. Participants strongly concurred that their pets were an integral part of their daily lives. Incidental and purposeful PA resulted from participants undertaking pet care and socially interacting with their pets. Pets may interrupt sedentary behaviors by nudging older adults to engage in PA as part of their daily lived experience. 

Who are the long sleepers? Towards an understanding of the mortality relationship. 
While much is known about the negative health implications of insufficient sleep, relatively little is known about risks associated with excessive sleep. However, epidemiological studies have repeatedly found a mortality risk associated with reported habitual long sleep. This paper will summarize and describe the numerous studies demonstrating increased mortality risk associated with long sleep. Although these studies establish a mortality link, they do not sufficiently explain why such a relationship might occur. Possible mechanisms for this relationship will be proposed and described, including (1) sleep fragmentation, (2) fatigue, (3) immune function, (4) photoperiodic abnormalities, (5) lack of challenge, (6) depression, or (7) underlying disease process such as (a) sleep apnea, (b) heart disease, or (c) failing health. Following this, we will take a step back and carefully consider all of the historical and current literature regarding long sleep, to determine whether the scientific evidence supports these proposed mechanisms and ascertain what future research directions may clarify or test these hypotheses regarding the relationship between long sleep and mortality. 

Ventilation rates in recently constructed U.S. school classrooms. 
Low ventilation rates (VRs) in schools have been associated with absenteeism, poorer academic performance, and teacher dissatisfaction. We measured VRs in 37 recently constructed or renovated and mechanically ventilated U.S. schools, including LEED and EnergyStar-certified buildings, using CO2 and the steady-state, build-up, decay, and transient mass balance methods. The transient mass balance method better matched conditions (specifically, changes in occupancy) and minimized biases seen in the other methods. During the school day, air change rates (ACRs) averaged 2.0+/-1.3 hour(-1) , and only 22% of classrooms met recommended minimum ventilation rates. HVAC systems were shut off at the school day close, and ACRs dropped to 0.21+/-0.19 hour(-1) . VRs did not differ by building type, although cost-cutting and comfort measures resulted in low VRs and potentially impaired IAQ. VRs were lower in schools that used unit ventilators or radiant heating, in smaller schools and in larger classrooms. The steady-state, build-up, and decay methods had significant limitations and biases, showing the need to confirm that these methods are appropriate. Findings highlight the need to increase VRs and to ensure that energy saving and comfort measures do not compromise ventilation and IAQ. 

Is couple therapy indicated for borderline personality disorder? 
The healing aspects of intimate relationships are being recognized by therapists and supported by empirical findings. Little has been written regarding the indications for couple therapy for individuals with borderline personality disorder. This paper proposes a three-level hierarchy for deciding on the suitability of couple therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. The hierarchy is based on three separate borderline behavioral clusters--impulsive, identity, and affective--that should be utilized to direct the application of couple therapy to specific patients. The three levels are illustrated by case examples. Delineation of the indications for couple therapy for borderline patients will foster further theoretical and empirical work in the area. 

Influence of Badminton Practice on Age-Related Changes in Patellar and Achilles Tendons. 
Regular sport practice could prevent age-related changes in tendinous tissues. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of regular badminton practice on patellar and Achilles tendon mechanical properties in senior competitive badminton players (>35 years old) and to compare the results with physically active people matched by age. One hundred ninety-two badminton players and 193 physically active people were divided by age into four groups, between 35 and 44 (U45), between 45 and 54 (U55), between 55 and 64 (U65), and over 65 (O65) years old. A LogiqS8 transducer in elastography mode and a MyotonPRO myotonometer were used to assess patellar and Achilles mechanical properties. Achilles tendon stiffness was higher in the control group than the badminton players for the U45, U55, and O65 age groups (p < .01). Also, the elastography index was higher in the control group than the badminton players for the U45, U55, U65, and O65 age groups (p < .05). In conclusion, regular badminton practice could prevent the decline in mechanical properties of the patellar and Achilles tendons. 

Deception Detection: The Relationship of Levels of Trust and Perspective Taking in Real-Time Online and Offline Communication Environments. 
Where humans have been found to detect lies or deception only at the rate of chance in offline face-to-face communication (F2F), computer-mediated communication (CMC) online can elicit higher rates of trust and sharing of personal information than F2F. How do levels of trust and empathetic personality traits like perspective taking (PT) relate to deception detection in real-time CMC compared to F2F? A between groups correlational design (N = 40) demonstrated that, through a paired deceptive conversation task with confederates, levels of participant trust could predict accurate detection online but not offline. Second, participant PT abilities could not predict accurate detection in either conversation medium. Finally, this study found that conversation medium also had no effect on deception detection. This study finds support for the effects of the Truth Bias and online disinhibition in deception, and further implications in law enforcement are discussed. 

How tobacco protects you against the flu. 
Under the heading "How tobacco protects you against the flu", the German chemical industry portrays a tobacco grower in an idyllic tobacco plantation. Despite the recent ban of transnational tobacco advertising within the European Union, using tobacco to promote another industry and potential societal health benefits might indirectly promote the social acceptability of tobacco to social leaders. The tobacco control community should thus monitor the use of other industries as a new method to circumvent the tobacco advertising ban and to support the social acceptability of tobacco by associating it with potential health benefits. 

A view from behind: a history of lingual orthodontics. 
Lingual orthodontic appliances have experienced a renaissance in the UK over the past 5 years, becoming more widely accepted as a suitable alternative to conventional labial appliances when treating most malocclusions. Clinically improved laboratory techniques have overcome many of the difficulties that a previous generation of orthodontists encountered when first trying to embrace this innovative technique to correct malocclusions. This article provides a brief history of lingual orthodontics. It will discuss the development of the technique, the reasons for its initial rise and fall in popularity, and more recent developments that have re-established its popularity among orthodontists in the UK. 

Potential Mandated Lowering of Nicotine Levels in Cigarettes: A Plant Perspective. 
The Food and Drug Administration has announced the potential for mandated lowering of nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes. The World Health Organization has recommended a lowering of cigarette filler nicotine levels to below 0.4 mg/g. To devise appropriate nicotine control strategies, regulators must consider technical feasibility, timelines for compliance, and potential impediments to implementation. Outlined here is previously unsummarized information on genetic approaches that might be used to reduce nicotine levels in cured tobacco leaves. For the benefit of regulators, altered alkaloid or toxicant profiles that might result by implementation of some of these methodologies are discussed. Also mentioned are potential licensing or regulatory impediments to use of some of the technologies per se. Implications: An understanding of technical feasibility of plant-based nicotine reduction technologies, along with the potential for corresponding alterations in alkaloid or toxicant profiles, is needed by regulators to develop effective nicotine control strategies with minimal impediments or undesirable consequences. 

Nicotine and 3-ethenylpyridine concentrations as markers for environmental tobacco smoke in restaurants. 
The Finnish Tobacco Act has restricted smoking in public places since 1976, and in 1994 the Act was amended to include workplaces as well. In 2000, the Tobacco Act will be expanded further to restaurants. In Finland, the exposure of clients and employees to the vapor phase environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in restaurants has not been systematically studied before by measuring ETS markers in indoor air. However, in these establishments the concentrations of ETS are expected to be much higher than in other workplaces. Gaseous nicotine and 3-ethenylpyridine were used as indicators of ETS in three different types of restaurants. Mean concentrations of nicotine ranged from 1.4-42.2 micrograms/m3 and 3-ethenylpyridine 1.4-6.3 micrograms/m3. In addition, concentrations of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), CO and CO2 were measured and concentrations were 183-2215 micrograms/m3, 0.9-3.1 mg/m3 and 600-880 ppm, respectively. The concentrations of ETS markers were highest in discos and nightclubs and lowest in restaurants. The concentrations of total volatile organic compounds were highest in discos and nightclubs, especially when smoke generators were used. 

Structured Play Therapy Groups for Preschoolers: facilitating the emergence of social competence. 
Over the years, we have developed a working model of Structured Play Therapy Groups for Preschoolers, an innovative treatment approach designed to address the needs of young children ages 3 to 5 struggling to adjust to the social demands of their preschool classrooms. These short-term therapy groups facilitate development of the young child's social competence and capacity to participate effectively in a classroom environment. Although the literature on therapy groups for children suggests that preschoolers are not yet evolved enough developmentally to engage actively in a group process, our experience indicates otherwise. The model of treatment presented here will therefore challenge that contention with the claim that not only can preschoolers participate in a structured therapy group of peers but they can, by virtue of that very participation, benefit in ways that will prepare them (as they transition from preschool to kindergarten) for the ever-increasing demands of their ever-expanding social milieus. 

Extended regimens of combined hormonal contraception to reduce symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding and the hormone-free interval: a systematic review of randomised and observational studies. 
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether continuous and extended regimens (CRs/ERs) of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) improve symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval and to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost of CRs/ERs to those of conventional 28-day regimens. STUDY DESIGN: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies published in any language between 2006 and 2013. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs and 14 observational studies evaluated issues related to our objectives. CRs/ERs, whose efficacy and safety were comparable to those described for conventional regimens, were preferred due to their improvement of symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval and the lower costs resulting from the reduced incidence of these symptoms. CONCLUSION: The contraceptive efficacy and safety of CR/ER use of CHCs is at least equal to that of 28-days conventional regimens, and this use may have some cost savings. CRs/ERs are recommended for women willing to take a CHC for treatment of symptoms related to withdrawal bleeding or the hormone-free interval. 

Treating problem gamblers: working towards empirically supported treatment. 
There is an urgent need for mental health professionals to develop effective treatments for pathological gambling. A scientific meeting was held in Quebec City in June 2002 where 13 specialists in the treatment of gamblers pursued the objectives of making the "State of the art" statement concerning the procedures and the methodology to be used in future treatment outcome studies. This paper introduces this special issue of the Journal of Gambling Studies and identifies some of the key issues that confront clinicians and researchers interested in evidence based treatment for gambling related disorders. 

Aliveness in the work of the group: a subjective guide to creative character change. 
The subjective response of aliveness in the work of the group may be a valuable signal on the journey toward creative character change in group therapy. In order to promote change in others, the group therapist must engage deeply and use internal responses as guides during interactions with group members as well as in relation to the group as a whole. Subjective awareness of increased aliveness that is linked with a sense of the work of the group may guide both therapist and group participants in the midst of inevitable anxieties and passions aroused during this quest for new vitality and freedom in relationships in the group. Winnicott's concept of potential space as well as group-relations theory about the primary task provide a conceptual foundation for this approach not only on the level of the individual member within the group but also on the level of the group as a whole. 

Mental health correlates of intimate partner violence in marital relationships in a nationally representative sample of males and females. 
It is important to understand the epidemiology of intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by both males and females. Data were drawn from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Replication. The relationships between physical IPV and child abuse, mental disorders, and suicidal ideation and attempts among males and females were examined. The results indicate that child sexual abuse was associated with IPV among males, whereas child physical and sexual abuse was associated with IPV among females. IPV was associated with poor mental health outcomes for males and females, although sex differences are noted. The sex differences indicate that females experience a wider range of poor mental health outcomes compared to males. Knowledge about correlates of IPV can be useful in identifying individuals exposed to violence. Further research is required to identify effective methods to reduce exposure to IPV and to adequately address the specific needs of male and female victims of IPV. 

Palm oil and human health. Meeting report of NFI: Nutrition Foundation of Italy symposium. 
The use of palm oil by the food industry is increasingly criticized, especially in Italy, for its purported negative effects on human health and environment. This paper summarizes the conclusions of a Symposium on this topic, gathered by the Nutrition Foundation of Italy, among experts representing a number of Italian Medical and Nutritional Scientific Societies. Toxicological and environmental issues were not considered. Participants agreed that: no evidence does exist on the specific health effects of palm oil consumption as compared to other saturated fatty acids-rich fats; the stereospecific distribution of saturated fatty acids in the triacylglycerol molecule of palm oil limits their absorption rate and metabolic effects; in agreement with International guidelines, saturated fatty acids intake should be kept <10% of total energy, within a balanced diet; within these limits, no effect of palm oil consumption on human health (and specifically on CVD or cancer risk) can be foreseen. 

Cardiorespiratory control: an integrated view. H.-P. Koepchen in memoriam. 
H.-P. Koepchen's presence at this symposium on cardiocirculatory function during sleep would have given us an inspiring impetus. His death has meant a severe loss for all of us. Koepchen's integrated view on cardiorespiratory control and rhythmicity has been the content of his late work. His considerations as documented in various papers are used for this contribution. They are based on earlier experimental studies of spontaneous coordinations of rhythmic activities in anaesthetized dogs, conscious men, and microelectrode recordings and local cooling experiments in the brain stem of anaesthetized dogs and cats, which he had worked on together with his students. 

Treatment of adolescents with Hansaplate/headgear. Influence on face in profile and on dentition. 
The treatment effects of Hansaplate/headgear in the course of 1 year were analyzed. Twenty-one girls and 19 boys, 10 and 11 years old, respectively, with postnormal occlusion and an average overjet of 8 mm, made up the treatment group. Forty untreated patients with the same type of malocclusion and dentofacial morphology as the treated children, and paired and matched for sex and age, made up the controls. Measurements were obtained from cephalometric headfilms. Matched-intrapairs analysis of control versus treatment changes after 1 year of treatment was done. This showed that the treatment resulted in inhibited sagittal growth of the maxilla, increased anterior face height and a flattened soft tissue profile with a less protrusive upper lip and a less pronounced sulcus mentolabialis. The overjet decreased by 5 mm on average. Only slight retroclination of the upper incisors without extrusion and retroclination of lower incisors to the mandibular plane occurred. No significant anterior positioning of the mandible as compared with the controls was recorded in this study. 

Tobacco price elasticity in Serbia: evidence from a middle-income country with high prevalence and low tobacco prices. 
In this paper, we use Deaton's demand model and Household Budget Survey data from 2006 to 2017 to provide a first robust and reliable estimate of cigarettes price elasticity for Serbia. The case of Serbia is particularly interesting and important as it provides evidence for a country in which tobacco market is characterised by the high tobacco consumption, low prices and large perceived impact of multinational tobacco companies on public revenues, export and employment, given their considerable cigarette production in Serbia. The price elasticity of cigarettes is estimated at -0.639, in line with the previous estimates for the low-income and middle-income countries. Estimated negative cigarettes price elasticity for Serbia suggests that tobacco tax policy could be used effectively to reduce cigarette consumption in Serbia, which could lower the harmful health effects of cigarettes. Furthermore, a calculation based on the estimated elasticity suggests that increasing tobacco taxes could also have positive fiscal effects, as the expected revenue from the taxes would increase. 

FCTC guidelines on tobacco industry foreign investment would strengthen controls on tobacco supply and close loopholes in the tobacco treaty. 
The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) contains no provisions covering tobacco industry investments. This creates the potential for tobacco companies to benefit from investment liberalisation by using foreign investments to avoid tobacco tariffs, increase tobacco consumption and otherwise impair the implementation of FCTC-style measures. Reducing and ultimately eliminating foreign investment activities by tobacco companies can be justified on health grounds, even though it runs counter to current investment liberalisation trends. Through the FCTC process, non-binding guidelines can be elaborated to assist parties in recognising and responding to foreign investment strategies of tobacco companies, to support efforts to exclude the tobacco sector from investment liberalisation and otherwise would improve all countries' awareness of the threat from foreign investment strategies of tobacco companies and provide them with approaches to handle the problems. 

Uranium levels in the diet of Sao Paulo City residents. 
Natural levels of uranium in the diet of Sao Paulo City residents were studied, and radionuclide concentrations were measured by the fission track method on samples of typical adult food items. This information was used to evaluate the daily intake of uranium in individuals living in Sao Paulo City which is, according to our findings, around 0.97 microg U/day. Using the ICRP Uranium-model, we estimated the uranium accumulation and committed doses in some tissues and organs, as function of time. We compared the output of the ICRP uranium biokinetic model, tailored for the conditions prevailing in Sao Paulo, with experimental data from other localities. Such comparison was possible by means of a simple method we developed, which allows normalization among experimental results from different regions where distinct values of chronic daily intake are observed. 

A review on pharmacological activities and utilization technologies of pumpkin. 
Dietary plants and herbal preparations have been traditionally used as medicine in developing countries and obtained a resurgence of use in the United States and Europe. Research carried out in last few decades has validated several such claims of use of traditional medicine plants. Popularity of pumpkin in various systems of traditional medicine for several ailments (antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antitumor, immunomodulation, antibacterial, antihypercholesterolemia, intestinal antiparasitia, antiinflammation, antalgic) focused the investigators' attention on this plant. Considerable evidence from several epidemiological studies concerning bioactivities leads have stimulated a number of animal model, cell culture studies and clinical trials designed to test this pharmacological actions. In addition, it was found that technologies such as germination and fermentation could reduce antinutritional materials and affect the pharmacological activities of pumpkin. This review will focus on the main medicinal properties and technologies of pumpkin, and point out areas for future research to further elucidate mechanisms whereby this compound may reduce disease risk. 

First Year Impacts of Casino Gambling in a Community. 
Gambling has become both a major pastime for Canadians and a multibillion dollar industry providing provincial governments with an increasing proportion of their annual revenues. The continuing trend toward the legalization of gambling has made research on the public health impacts of gambling increasingly important to citizens and decision-makers. This article presents first year results of a multi-year project to measure the impact of the opening of Casino Windsor on gambling behaviour in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. A random telephone survey of gambling behaviour was conducted with 2,682 adult residents of metropolitan Windsor prior to the opening of Casino Windsor, and was repeated with 2,581 residents one year later. There were no statistically significant changes in the rates of problem and pathological gambling among men, women, or the general population one year following the opening of the casino. Although there was some evidence of higher-spending gamblers within the post-casino sample, no statistically significant differences were found between pre- and post-casino per capita gambling expenditures. Implications of these results for the future measurement and treatment of problem and pathological gambling are discussed. 

Two-year follow-up study of cognitive behavioral therapy for sexually abused children suffering post-traumatic stress symptoms. 
OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to determine whether the 12-session pre- to posttest therapeutic gains that had been found by Deblinger, Lippmann. and Steer (1996) for an initial sample of 100 sexually abused children suffering posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms would be sustained 2 years after treatment. METHOD: These sexually abused children, along with their nonoffending mothers, had been randomly assigned to one of three cognitive-behavioral treatment conditions, child only, mother only, or mother and child, or a community comparison condition, and were followed for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment. RESULTS: A series of repeated MANCOVAs, controlling for the pre-test scores, indicated that for the three measures of psychopathology that had significantly decreased in the original study (i.e., externalizing behavior problems, depression, and PTSD symptoms), these measures at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were comparable to the posttest scores. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the pre- to post-treatment improvements held across the 2-year follow-up period. The clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed. 

Gabapentin acutely increases the apnea-hypopnea index in older men: data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Although drugs with sedative properties may increase the risk of airway collapse during sleep, their acute effects on the apnea-hypopnea index in older adults are under-reported. We investigated the acute effects of gabapentin (GABA) on sleep breathing in older men without sleep apnea. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over pilot study using a bedtime dose of gabapentin 300 mg was conducted in eight non-obese older men. Polysomnography measured the effects of the intervention. The apnea-hypopnea index was higher in the gabapentin arm than in the placebo arm (22.4 +/- 6.1 versus 12.2 +/- 4.3, P <= 0.05, d: 0.67), as was the oxygen desaturation index (20.6 +/- 5.8 versus 10.8 +/- 3.9, P <= 0.05, d: 0.68). The number needed to harm was four. A subset analysis demonstrated that differences in sleep respiratory parameters were present only during non-rapid eye movement sleep, as well as only in the supine position. No adverse events were reported. Hence, gabapentin worsened sleep breathing acutely compared with placebo. Long-term clinical trials are warranted to elucidate the clinical relevance of these findings for the safety profile of GABAergic agents. 

The Masterson Approach with play therapy: a parallel process between mother and child. 
This paper discusses a case in which the Masterson Approach was used with play therapy to treat a child with a developing personality disorder. It describes the parallel progression of the child and mother in adjunct therapy throughout a six-year period. The unique value of the Masterson Approach is that it provides the therapist with a framework and tool to diagnose and treat a child during the dynamic process of play. The case describes the mother-child dyad throughout therapy. It traces their parallel processes that involve separation, individuation, rapprochement, and the recovery of real self-capacities. Each stage of treatment is described, including verbal interventions. The child's internal affective state and intrapsychic structure during the various stages of treatment are illustrated by representative pictures. 

The mediating role of perceived social support in the relationship between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being. 
Studies show that morningness preference and subjective well-being are positively related. However, little is known about potential factors that may underpin this association. In the present study, we explored the mediational role of general social support and its facets (family, friends, and significant other) in the relationship between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being. The present study was conducted with a sample of 1,067 adults (51% women), with a mean (SD, range) age of 36.41 (9.95, 18-55) years. Our results corroborated earlier findings that morningness was positively associated with both subjective well-being and social support. Controlling for age and gender, we obtained significant mediation effects, showing that the association between morningness-eveningness and subjective well-being might stem, at least in part, from the higher levels of social support received by morning-oriented individuals. This may lead to the conclusion that social support is an important antecedent of the greater well-being reported by morning-oriented individuals. 

Hemodynamic Function of Forearm Muscle in Postmenopausal Women With Type 2 Diabetes. 
Changes in the hemodynamic function of muscle are speculated as a causal mechanism for reduced motor capabilities with aging in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The focus of this study was to evaluate changes in muscle oxygenation during sustained force production in postmenopausal women with DM compared with controls. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin in the flexor digitorum superficialis. Sensorimotor function and health state covariates were also assessed. Increased deoxyhemoglobin was found during force production, whereas oxyhemoglobin remained constant. Changes were found in the time structure of the hemodynamic data during force production. No between-group differences were found; instead, measures covaried with the health state. Sex-based differences in the manifestation of DM-related sensorimotor dysfunction are likely. These data indicate that basic cardiovascular health measures may be more beneficial to monitoring hyperemic status and muscle function in postmenopausal women with DM, compared with DM diagnosis. 

An in-session exploration of ruptures in working alliance and their associations with clients' core conflictual relationship themes, alliance-related discourse, and clients' postsession evaluations. 
This exploratory study examined (a) the relationship among the occurrence of ruptures in the working alliance, the emergence of client's core conflictual relationship themes (CCRT), and focus of discourse within therapeutic sessions and (b) the relationship between ruptures in the working alliance and client's postsession evaluations of session's smoothness and depth. The authors included 151 sessions from five therapies conducted in a student counseling center. Sessions were content analyzed by independent raters, and a self-report questionnaire was given to clients after each session. Ruptures were positively related to the emergence of clients' CCRT during the session, but only when the therapist was addressed as the "other." Sessions with ruptures were characterized by heightened discussion of working alliance components and were evaluated as less smooth than sessions without ruptures. Findings are discussed, and the importance of ruptures in working alliance for therapeutic change is emphasized. 

Lingual orthodontics (Part 4): Economic lingual treatment (ECO-lingual therapy). 
One key factor in the economic lingual treatment concept presented in this series of articles is the use of prefabricated, customized nickel titanium arch wires with superelasticity and temperature-dependent spring-back qualities (memory effect). Using a modern, e-modulus driven archwire sequence, a non-extraction case can be treated with 1 or 2 wires per arch, and an extraction case with 2 or 3 wires per arch. This article, the last in the Lingual Orthodontics series, uses clinical examples to show the various clinical potentials of these wires with temperature-dependent superelasticity, as not only part of but occasionally all the treatment is done with these prefabricated, customized nickel titanium wires. 

Particulate emission rates for unpaved shoulders along a paved road. 
This paper reports the first empirical estimate of particle emissions from unpaved shoulders along paved roads. Its objectives are to develop and demonstrate an emission rate measurement methodology that can be applied in different areas; identify the mechanisms that suspend dust from unpaved shoulders and the observables related to this suspension process; and quantify PM10 mass emissions in the form of an emission rate. To achieve these objectives, fast-response observations from nephelometers and a sonic anemometer were used to characterize short-lived dust plumes generated by passing vehicles. In addition, detailed soil surface measurements determined the mechanical properties of the shoulder surfaces. Large traffic-induced turbulence events that led to significant dust entrainment were almost exclusively caused by "large" vehicles such as trucks, semis, and vehicles pulling trailers, all traveling 50-65 mph. PM10 emission rates for these large, fast-traveling vehicles were determined to be 8 +/- 4 grams per vehicle kilometer traveled under dry conditions. Emissions due to smaller vehicles such as cars, vans, and sport utility vehicles were negligible for normal on-road driving. These results indicate that the majority of PM10 emissions from unpaved shoulders is caused by relatively few vehicles. 

Implementation of napping in industry and the problem of sleep inertia. 
It seems reasonable to believe that in specific situations napping at the work place would be possible and used if authorized and encouraged. Very short naps could have very positive long-term effects on biological functions. Training someone to sleep for short periods appears feasible if there is a high motivation to do so. Sleep inertia can be considered as one of the main limiting factors in napping strategy. Sleep inertia depends on different factors such as sleep stage preceding the awakening, temporal placement of the nap, duration of nap and wakefulness preceding it, etc. The effects of sleep inertia might be different depending on the type of task, and a reactivation technique applied immediately after awakening may remove it. Despite the fact that its implementation in industry raises some practical issues, napping can be considered as a possible strategy to increase the vigilance level of night workers. 

Kiwifruit Skin and Flesh Contributions to Fecal Bulking and Bacterial Abundance in Rats. 
Changes in fecal bulk and bacterial abundance due to separately consumed skin and flesh of four kiwifruit cultivars was determined using a rat model designed to estimate the fecal bulking potential of human foods. Dry matter contribution by skin to 100 g of fresh kiwifruit was less than 5% in all cultivars, whereas flesh dry matter contributed up to 20% of fresh fruit weight. Dietary fiber was 35-49% of skin compared with 8-23% of flesh on a dry weight basis. The skin significantly increased whole fruit fecal bulking, but the total bulk per 100 g kiwifruit was less than 10% of daily fecal bulk recommended for optimal gut health. Kiwifruit (skin or flesh) substantially increased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillus spp. within the gut. Fermentation and prebiosis therefore probably play a greater role than fermentation-resistant dietary fiber in gut health benefits of kiwifruit. 

Predicting the determinants of users' intentions for using YouTube to share video: moderating gender effects. 
This research aims to improve understanding of what motivates individual online users to share their videos on YouTube and whether gender affects those motivations. The work proposes a model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and social influences theory by conducting a survey of 206 male and 135 female video sharers of YouTube to test this model. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is an important determinant of the intention to use YouTube to share video. All factors from the social influence perspective significantly affect the intention to use YouTube to share video. The results show that differences exist in sharing behavior between female and male users. Female users' intention is strongly influenced by usefulness and social norms, while male users' intention is strongly influenced by interpersonal norms. Based on those findings, implications for theory and practice are discussed. 

Sexual function changes attributed to hormonal contraception use - a qualitative study of women experiencing negative effects. 
Objective: To increase the understanding of women who experience negative effects on sexual function when using hormonal contraception.Methods: We performed 24 in-depth interviews with women who had previously experienced negative sexual function effects while using hormonal contraceptives. The thematic analysis method was used.Results: 'After experience comes insight', 'Lubrication and desire go hand in hand', 'Mental wellbeing comes before desire' and 'The contraceptive counsellor potentially facilitates insight and decision-making' were the main themes found in the study.Conclusions: This selected group of women described lubrication difficulties and decreased sexual desire associated with both contraceptive use and the menstrual cycle. Contraceptive use became easier with age and with better understanding. The contraceptive counsellor could facilitate the process. Further choice between hormonal or non-hormonal contraceptive methods depended primarily on experienced adverse effects on mood, and secondarily on sexual function, weighed against the advantages or disadvantages experienced during the person's own menstrual cycle. 

Transverse myelitis following methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a case report. 
OBJECTIVE: Ectopic pregnancy is a common condition in the field of gynaecology, often treated with methotrexate. Adverse effects are common and usually mild. Severe adverse events are rare amongst patients treated with MTX for this condition. CASE: A 26-year-old healthy woman was admitted and treated medically with MTX for an ectopic pregnancy. The patient was treated in the standard drug labelled protocol with an intramuscular injection of 78 mg of MTX according to body surface area. Soon after, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of bilateral paresthesia of the lower limbs which ascended to the pelvis. After a thorough work up and imaging via MRI a diagnosis of transverse myelitis was made. Treatment was successful with corticosteroids and symptoms subsided. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that MTX should be used with caution and severe toxicity should be kept in mind with high index of awareness for any symptom development following treatment, especially neurological one. 

Metaphor and psychotherapy. 
The authors describe the role of metaphor in the theory and practice of psychotherapy. Metaphors are considered fundamental elements of our worlds of language and concepts and not just figures of speech, poetic devices, parables, or creative ways to make interpretations. Metaphors shape the process of therapy by structuring the therapist's perceptions, stance, and attitude. They also organize the way problems are discussed as well as the solution that are seen as effective. The authors review the literature on metaphor in psychotherapy and explore common psychotherapeutic metaphors such as "psychotherapy is war," "the mind is a brittle object," "the conduit metaphor," and a variety of somatic metaphors. They conclude with a discussion of how metaphors function in the process of psychotherapy. 

Artificial vs natural Stachybotrys infestation-Comparison of mycotoxin production on various building materials. 
The genus Stachybotrys belongs to filamentous fungi found in indoor environment, mostly on cellulose-rich substrates after water-damage. The major purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of different building materials in case of mold infestation on the mycotoxin production of Stachybotrys species. Fifteen Stachybotrys mycotoxins including satratoxins, phenylspirodrimanes, and recently discovered stachybotrychromenes were in the focus of the investigations. Artificial and natural infestations were compared to determine whether environmental factors, for example, time of growth, temperature, humidity, and material additives have an influence on the observed mycotoxin profiles. It turned out that mycotoxin profiles from Stachybotrys spp. on building materials can be influenced by cellulose, paints, and paste of the materials. The total toxin levels of artificially and naturally contaminated gypsum board samples ranged up to 30 microg/cm(2) , whereas wallpaper samples showed total toxin levels in the range of 20-66 microg/cm(2) . A naturally infested sample disclosed the conversion of the dialdehyde components to the corresponding lactone isomers under the influence of light. 

Strength training. Single versus multiple sets. 
Perhaps the most controversial element of any strength training programme is the number of sets required to increase muscular strength and hypertrophy. There is a prevalent belief that at least 3 sets of each exercise are required to elicit optimal increases in strength and hypertrophy. However, most of the studies that reported the results of training with single versus multiple sets do not substantiate this tenet. In fact, the preponderance of evidence suggests that for training durations of 4 to 25 weeks there is no significant difference in the increase in strength or hypertrophy as a result of training with single versus multiple sets. Because of the design limitations of these studies, conclusions concerning the efficacy of multiple sets should be tentative. However, there is little scientific evidence, and no theoretical physiological basis, to suggest that a greater volume of exercise elicits greater increases in strength or hypertrophy. This information may represent an important practical application of time-efficient, low-volume exercise. 

Modeling Longitudinal Relationships Between Habit and Physical Activity: Two Cross-Lagged Panel Design Studies in Older Adults. 
These longitudinal studies in older adults targeted mediated relationships between habit and physical activity (PA). In The Netherlands two independent studies were conducted among 1976 (Study 1: Mage = 63.63, SD = 8.66, 30% functional limitations) and 2140 (Study 2: Mage = 62.75, SD = 8.57, 45% functional limitations) adults aged 50 years or older. Cross-lagged panel designs were applied to examine whether habit mediates the relationship between prior and later PA and whether PA simultaneously mediates the relationship between prior and later habit. Data on habit and PA were collected by means of questionnaires at baseline (t0) and at 6 (t1) and 12 (t2) months after baseline measurement. Results of structural equation modeling analyses were not unambiguous. Indications for the existence of both hypothesized mediation effects were found, but no clear, unequivocal pattern appeared. Somewhat more support was found for the PA-habit-PA path than for the habit-PA-habit path. More research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions. 

Interdisciplinary concepts in treating adult patients. 
Pre-prosthetics, as a part of orthodontic treatment in adults has gained increasing importance during recent years. Through coordinated orthodontic, prosthetic and periodontal treatment plans, patients with partial dentition can be offered further treatment possibilities. Such planning would allow for fixed prosthetic treatment possibilities and the survival of critical teeth. They would provide for better aesthetics and avoid functional disturbances. The aim of the present study was to present reports of patients treated by coordinated work at the Dental School of Hamburg University. In patients with partial dentition, premolars were uprighted and distally moved and molars were extruded to be used as abutments for fixed prosthetic reconstructions. Following trauma, the position of the remaining anterior teeth was improved to provide for optimal aesthetics after prosthetic treatment. Extraction of a subalveolarly fractured tooth is avoided through root extrusion and post-core reconstruction. The results demonstrate the advantages of pre-prosthetic treatment as regards stability, aesthetics and function. With the help of pre-prosthetic orthodontic treatment, complicated treatment situations could be handled more successfully than would have been the case without such treatment. 

A chemical dynamic model for the infiltration of outdoor size-resolved ammonium nitrate aerosols to indoor environments. 
In the present study, we developed a chemical dynamic model to describe the infiltration of size-resolved ammonium nitrate aerosols from outdoor to indoor environments. This model considered the penetration factor, deposition rate, and the reversible reaction process, which was quantified by the diffusive molar flux on the surface of ammonium nitrate aerosols depending on indoor temperature, humidity, and concentrations of nitric acid (HNO3 ) and ammonia (NH3 ). To verify the model, we employed a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer with an automated switching system to simultaneously measure size-resolved outdoor and indoor ammonium nitrate aerosols. Comparisons between the predicted and measured concentrations of these aerosols showed a mean relative error of 4.8 +/- 18.3%. To analyze the sensitivity of model parameters, several parameters were perturbed. This analysis indicated that parameters related to HNO3 were more sensitive than those related to NH3 because the indoor gas phase concentration of NH3 was much higher than that of HNO3 . 

The nutritive value of selected commonly consumed Kuwaiti dishes. 
The nutritive value of 33 dishes commonly consumed in the state of Kuwait was analyzed. On a fresh weight basis, the moisture content of the dishes ranged from 0.29% to 94.37%, protein content from 0.65% to 24.80%, and fat content from 0.03% to 59.22%. The crude fiber ranged from a low value of 0.04% to a maximum of 2.31%; with the exception of four dishes-Sw-20 (Samsamia), Sw-26 (Harda), V-31 (Hameesat Mushroom), V-32 (Hameesat Fagae)-all dishes had a low fiber level, <1 g/100 g. The ash content ranged from 0.09% to 3.66%. Carbohydrate showed a variation between 3.98% and 81.37%; the highest carbohydrate values were in sweets and rice-based dishes, while the lowest values were in soup and cheese dishes. The energy content of the dishes varied between 19 and 675 kcal/100 g (80-2,823 kJ/100 g). The dishes contributed 5-90%, 1-46% and 1-83% of the total food energy from carbohydrate, protein and fat, respectively. 

Longitudinal Association Between Physical Activity and Body Fat During Adolescence: A Systematic Review. 
BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) practice has been inversely associated to body fat (BF) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association of PA and BF in adolescence. METHODS: The review includes 18 longitudinal studies found in the PubMed database, comprising papers published from January 1990 to July 2014. Studies assessing BF only through body mass index were excluded. RESULTS: Among the outcomes analyzed, waist circumference, skinfolds, and absolute and relative fat mass measurement were identified. Questionnaires were the more predominant way to evaluate PA. Most studies showed that PA promotes a protective effect against a higher BF gain. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that PA has a protective effect against BF with differences between the genders and according to the BF marker or measurement assessed; higher intensity PA leads to a greater effect against BF gain in both genders; and the maintenance or increase of PA level on BF observed through analysis of change in PA level yielded more consistent findings in the relation between PA and BF. 

Philip Morris International-funded 'Foundation for a Smoke-Free World': analysing its claims of independence. 
The Foundation for a Smoke-Free World was launched in September 2017 with an announced 12-year funding commitment of $1 billion from Philip Morris International (PMI). The Foundation claims that its governing documents (certificate of incorporation, bylaws and a pledge agreement) ensure that it has an independent research agenda and stringent protections from conflicts of interest. We analysed the text of these governing documents. Their provisions have multiple loopholes, particularly regarding conflicts of interest. Further, these documents cannot substitute for other important documentation such as information about PMI's internal business case for investing $1 billion in the Foundation, an unwaivable conflict of interest policy, annual disclosure statements, copies of pre-Foundation establishment correspondence between key individuals, all signed contracts or salary information, none of which, as of July 2018, the Foundation has made publicly available. Even if these were released, however, it is problematic that the Foundation's fundamental purpose was decided on and its leader selected following a tobacco company-paid, privately negotiated arrangement with the Foundation's president. It cannot be regarded as independent. 

Agreement between virtual and in-the-field environmental audits of assisted living sites. 
The authors investigated the use of Google Earth's Street View option to audit the presence of built environment features that support older adults' walking. Two raters conducted virtual (Street View) and in-the-field audits of 48 street segments surrounding urban and suburban assisted living sites in metropolitan Vancouver, BC, Canada. The authors determined agreement using absolute agreement. Their findings indicate that Street View may identify the presence of features that promote older adults' walking, including sidewalks, benches, public washrooms, and destinations. However, Street View may not be as reliable as in-the-field audits to identify details associated with certain items, such as counts of trees or street lights; presence, features, and height of curb cuts; and sidewalk continuity, condition, and slope. Thus, the appropriateness of virtual audits to identify microscale built environment features associated with older adults' walking largely depends on the purpose of the audits-specifically, whether the measurer seeks to capture highly detailed features of the built environment. 

Prodynorphin gene deficiency potentiates nalbuphine-induced behavioral sensitization and withdrawal syndrome in mice. 
Dynorphin is the presumed endogenous ligand for the kappa-opioid receptor. The dynorphin gene may play a role in psychotropic agent-mediated behavioral changes via dopaminergic modulation. Therefore, in this study, possible involvement of the dynorphin gene in nalbuphine-mediated behavioral responses was examined using prodynorphin (Pdyn) gene knock-out (-/-) mice. Pdyn gene deficiency potentiates nalbuphine-induced behavioral sensitization of locomotor activity and accumbal c-Fos expression. Administration of nalbuphine induced a significant increase in the dialysate dopamine level in the nucleus accumbens. This increase was more pronounced in the Pdyn (-/-) mice than in the wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, Pdyn (-/-) mice were more vulnerable to the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome (i.e., teeth chattering, wet dog shakes, forepaw tremors, jumping, weight loss, and global withdrawal score) after repeated treatment with nalbuphine than the WT mice. Consistently, nor-binaltorphimine, a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, significantly potentiated nalbuphine-induced behavioral effects in WT mice, whereas U-50488H, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, significantly attenuated these changes in Pdyn (-/-) mice in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that the kappa-opioid receptor/dynorphin system is specifically modulated in response to behavioral sensitization and withdrawal signs induced by nalbuphine. 

The development of scales to measure the experience of self-participation in sleep. 
Recent literature suggests that how the self is represented is a cardinal aspect of the dream experience. A review of studies of phasic-tonic distinctions within rapid eye movement (REM) sleep revealed that increasing self-participation marked awakenings from phasic intervals. Five scales specifically designed to measure absorption in dreaming were compared with three scales previously shown to discriminate phasic from tonic awakenings within REM sleep. Eight reports per night (two stage REM, six stage 2) were collected from each of 20 subjects on 4 baseline nights. Awakenings were controlled for time into the REMP and time of night, correcting the methodological flaws of previous studies in this area. Scales developed to measure self-participation were able to discriminate phasic from tonic awakenings better than those already in the literature. Results are discussed in terms of the psychometric properties of the individual scales. 

Contribution of (222)Rn-bearing water to the occupational exposure in thermal baths. 
The present study investigates the short- and long-term effects of radon ((222)Rn) released from water on the progeny exposure in a thermal spa. For the purposes of this work, the Polichnitos spa was used as a case study. The bathroom was supplied with water containing 110-210 kBq m(-3) of (222)Rn. The (222)Rn concentration in air and the short-lived (222)Rn progenies in attached and unattached form were monitored into the bathroom and the surrounding premises. The equilibrium factor (F-factor) and the unattached fraction were estimated. The results of this study show that water flow during bath filling is by far the dominant mechanism by which (222)Rn is released in the air of the bathroom. The progeny exposure was correlated linearly with the (222)Rn concentration in the entering water. The annual effective dose received by a worker was found to be below the lower limit value of 3 mSv recommended by ICRP 65. The dose limit was exceeded only for water containing more than 300 kBq m(-3). 

Effect of olive oil phenolic compounds on the expression of blood pressure-related genes in healthy individuals. 
PURPOSE: To investigate whether the ingestion of olive oil having different phenolic contents influences the expression of blood pressure-related genes, involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in healthy humans. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, crossover human trial with 18 healthy subjects, who ingested 25 mL/day of olive oils (1) high (366 mg/kg, HPC) and (2) low (2.7 mg/kg, LPC) in phenolic compounds for 3 weeks, preceded by 2-week washout periods. Determination of selected blood pressure-related gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by qPCR, blood pressure and systemic biomarkers. RESULTS: HPC decreased systolic blood pressure compared to pre-intervention values and to LPC, and maintained diastolic blood pressure values compared to LPC. HPC decreased ACE and NR1H2 gene expressions compared with pre-intervention values, and IL8RA gene expression compared with LPC. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction to the diet of an extra-virgin olive oil rich in phenolic compounds modulates the expression of some of the genes related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These changes could underlie the decrease in systolic blood pressure observed. 

Tarasoff decision: a decade later dilemma still faces psychotherapists. 
The landmark cases on the "duty to warn" concept are reviewed. Two trends are noted in the court rulings. The first trend narrowly interprets the duty to warn as applying only to situations involving a serious threat to a specific individual. The second trend has broadened the doctrine to include warnings about patients who do not make threats and whose potential victims are unspecified. The authors argue that the original Tarasoff Doctrine is sound both from the perspective of public policy and psychotherapeutic practice, but that its broader interpretation is problematic for psychotherapists. 

Suitability of using sieved or unsieved maize mash for production of "OGI"--a fermented cereal food. 
Proximate analysis of sieved and unsieved maize mash revealed that there was a decrease in the protein and lipid content of the sieved maize mash as compared to that of the unsieved maize mash. Crude fibre and ash was completely absent in the sieved maize mash, while they were present in the unsieved mash. Chemical analysis of the fermented unsieved maize mash revealed an increase in the protein content from 9.9% (unfermented) to 13.4% after 3 days of fermentation, whereas the protein content of the sieved maize mash increased from 7.1% (unfermented) to 8.4% after the same period of fermentation. Furthermore, the results revealed that the protein content of the fermented unsieved maize mash was 32.1% higher than that of the fermented sieved maize mash indicating that the unsieved maize mash was of a better nutrient quality and should be preferred to sieved maize mash for use in "Ogi" production. 

The relationship between young adults' beliefs about anonymity and subsequent cyber aggression. 
Anonymity is considered a key motivator for cyber aggression, but few investigations have focused on the connection between anonymity and the subsequent engagement in aggression through the cyber context. The present longitudinal study utilized structural equation modeling to reveal indirect associations between two types of anonymity (i.e., punishment by authority figures and retaliation from the target) and later cyber aggression among 130 young adults. These relationships were examined through the influence of beliefs about not getting caught and not believing in the permanency of online content. Findings indicated that both forms of anonymity were related to cyber aggression 6 months later through two explanatory mechanisms (i.e., confidence with not getting caught and believing online content is not permanent), after controlling for gender and cyber aggression at Time 1. The implications of these findings are discussed, and an appeal for additional research investigating cyber aggression among young adults is given. 

Selection of Resistance Exercises for Older Individuals: The Forgotten Variable. 
Resistance training has been widely recommended as a strategy to enhance the functional autonomy and quality of life in older individuals. Among the variables that comprise a training session, the selection of exercises stands out as an important consideration for the elderly. Although a wide range of resistance exercise options exists, current guidelines generally do not indicate which exercises should be included and which muscles should be prioritized when prescribing training for older individuals. Therefore, given the lack of evidence-based information on the topic, this paper endeavors to establish recommendations to help guide the prescription of resistance exercises for older adults. 

Hypodontia, Oligodontia and Anodontia in West Virginia Appalachia. 
Purpose: Children in West Virginia have a high prevalence of missing permanent teeth when compared to children in the rest of the nation. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent tooth hypodontia/oligodontia/anodontia in West Virginia children and to compare the prevalence by sex.Methods: Five hundred panoramic radiographs of West Virginia children, ages 6-11 years, were examined for missing permanent tooth buds/permanent teeth. Data analyses included frequency determinations, Chi square analyses, and logistic regression.Results: Sixty children (12.0%, n=500) had at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth. There were 15.5% of females and 8.8% of males who had at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth. In adjusted logistic regression on at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth, females had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.11 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.18, 3.75; p = .011] compared with males. Other variables in the analysis failed to reach significance.Conclusion: In this sample of West Virginia children, females were more likely to have at least one missing permanent tooth bud/permanent tooth compared to males. Early recognition and treatment planning for dental care is needed for children with hypodontia/oligodontia/anodontia. 

Homicidal commotio cordis: the final blow in a battered infant. 
OBJECTIVE: This report describes in detail the occurrence of inflicted commotio cordis (cardiac concussion) in a previously abused 7-week-old. Though inflicted commotio cordis has been reported in three toddlers, this is the first report in a young infant. METHOD: Following documentation of abuse in a living child, the case of a death of a prior sibling--previously regarded as natural--was re-opened for further investigation. Original autopsy materials were reviewed, and the body of the deceased child was exhumed. RESULTS: Exhumation and second autopsy documented more than 50 fractures in the deceased child. When re-interviewed, the children's father admitted to causing the injuries in both children, and gave a textbook description of commotio cordis as the mechanism of death in the fatal case. CONCLUSIONS: Commotio cordis is a rare event in which a fatal dysrhythmia--usually ventricular fibrillation--is precipitated by a blow to the precordial chest. Previous reports have indicated that homicidal commotio cordis can occur in small children. This report demonstrates that commotio cordis can occur even in the very young, previously abused infant. 

Effects of high-AGE beverage on RAGE and VEGF expressions in the liver and kidneys. 
BACKGROUND: The formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) increase in some lifestyle-related diseases as well as in aging; however, little is known about the relationship between food-derived AGEs and the pathology of such diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY AND METHODS: To explore whether food items containing high levels of AGEs are involved in the development of lifestyle-related diseases, rats were orally administered a commercial high-AGE beverage [Lactobacillus beverage-A (LB-A)]. With a particular focus on angiogenesis-associated diseases, the gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) were examined in the liver and kidneys using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, AGE deposition was immunohistochemically investigated in these tissues. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic VEGF expression was significantly increased in rats administered LB-A (P < 0.01 vs. control). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis detected glucose-derived AGE-positive cells in the liver from the LB-A group. These results suggest that AGE-rich beverages increase hepatic VEGF expression and AGE accumulation, bringing about early events associated with lifestyle-related diseases. 

Online security and cyberbystander relations in mobilizing sex abuse intervention. 
Two studies examined men's interventions in a virtual reality situation involving child grooming. In Study 1, 92 men observed an online encounter between an apparent minor and a sex offender. The results suggest that the bystander effect was stronger under computerized rather than user-assisted surveillance, and when the fellow cyberbystander was unknown rather than known. In Study 2, where 100 men observed the same encounter, the effect also emerged under computerized surveillance as long as the number unknown cyberbystanders was increased. Thus, vesting more responsibility for security in the average netizen rather than just in the automated abuse-detection technology is cautiously suggested, the relevance of which lies in increasing minors' health and safety. 

Monitoring of the benzene and toluene contents in human milk. 
Twenty-three samples of human milk collected from the milk bank of a children's hospital were analysed with a view to monitoring the possible presence of some of the most common aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) and to quantify their concentrations. The analysis was carried out by the "purge and trap" technique combined with gas chromatography and with the use of the mass spectrometer as detector. The hydrocarbons themselves were used in a deuterated form as internal standards. The analysis of the data showed the presence of both hydrocarbons, even though their quantity was much lower than that detected in other foods. 

A recurrent central giant cell granuloma in a young patient and orthodontic treatment: a case report. 
Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) is an uncommon benign intraosseous lesion of the jaw, found predominantly in children and young adults below 30 years of age. The purpose of this article was to present a summary of the current literature and a case report of an 11-year-old boy diagnosed with an aggressive CGCG involving the anterior maxilla that was removed in 2004 and subsequently recurred almost 3 years later in 2006. The presenting features of the patient and the effect of combined surgical and orthodontic treatment for this condition are discussed. This case shows how the dentition was successfully maintained with conservative surgery and orthodontic treatment in spite of the extensive destruction of the supporting bone, and the importance of long-term follow-up. The report also reminds orthodontic practitioners that rare pathological conditions can occur in their child patient groups. 

Improving urban air quality in China: Beijing case study. 
China is undergoing rapid urbanization because of unprecedented economic growth. As a result, many cities suffer from air pollution. Two-thirds of China's cities have not attained the ambient air quality standards applicable to urban residential areas (Grade II). Particulate matter (PM), rather than sulfur dioxide (SO2), is the major pollutant reflecting the shift from coal burning to mixed source pollution. In 2002, 63.2 and 22.4% of the monitored cities have PM and SO2 concentrations exceeding the Grade II standard, respectively. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentration kept a relatively stable level near the Grade II standard in the last decade and had an increasing potential in recent years because of the rapid motorization. In general, the air pollutants emission did not increase as quickly as the economic growth and energy consumption, and air quality in Chinese cities has improved to some extent. Beijing, a typical representative of rapidly developing cities, is an example to illustrate the possible options for urban air pollution control. Beijing's case provides hope that the challenges associated with improving air quality can be met during a period of explosive development and motorization. 

Strategic and contested use of food laws to ban smokeless tobacco products in India: a qualitative analysis of litigation. 
OBJECTIVE: To understand how food laws are used, contested and interpreted to ban certain forms of chewing tobacco in India. METHODS: A qualitative study analysing all the tobacco-related litigation under the food laws in India. We used an inductive thematic analysis of the litigation contents. RESULTS: The tobacco industry systematically deployed litigation to (1) challenge the categorisation of smokeless tobacco products as food, and hence, questioned the use of food laws for regulating these products; (2) challenge the regulatory power of the state government in banning tobacco products via the food laws; and (3) challenge the applicability of the general food laws that enabled stricter regulations beyond what is prescribed under the tobacco-specific law. CONCLUSION: Despite facing several legal challenges from the tobacco industry, Indian states optimised food laws to enable stricter regulations on smokeless tobacco products than were feasible through use of a tobacco-specific law. 

Effects of salicylic acid-induced wine rich in anthocyanins on metabolic parameters and adipose insulin signaling in high-fructose fed rats. 
We evaluated the effects of Syrah red wine treated with salicylic acid (RW SA) and its control red wine (RW) on metabolic parameters, systolic blood pressure and adipose tissue insulin signaling in high-fructose (F) fed rats. Grape treated with SA increased the anthocyanin (ANTs) levels in RW. F induced increased systolic blood pressure, dislipidemia and insulin resistance (HOMA:IR). F rats treated with RW significantly prevented these alterations while RW SA partially attenuated triglycerides levels and HOMA:IR without modifications in HDL cholesterol levels. F impaired the adipose tissue response to insulin. Supplementation with RW and RW SA partially attenuated these alterations. Rats supplemented with RW SA had lesser beneficial effects on metabolic alterations than control RW, while both RW and RW SA attenuated altered adipose response to insulin. More studies are necessary to deeply evaluate the effect on SA-induced RW rich in ANTs levels on metabolic alterations associated to MetS. 

Long-term effects of incest: life events triggering mental disorders in female patients with sexual abuse in childhood. 
The authors studied several psychosocial, psychosomatic, and psychodynamic factors in 33 female psychiatric patients who had been victims of incest. Abuse was almost exclusively severe and prolonged. Three quarters of the female patients had been abused by their biological fathers or stepfathers. Sexual abuse experiences in childhood are connected with feelings of anxiety, helplessness, and powerlessness. Together with a lack of support on the part of the mother, these experiences lead to ego weakness, an autoplastic mode of coping with aggression and to patterns of objectal relationships which predispose them to object loss. The links between a girl's traumatic experiences in relationships and her vulnerability to separation in later life and their importance for the incidence of mental disorders will be discussed on the basis of Bowlby's attachment theory. 

The antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid attenuates intermittent hypoxia-related renal injury in a mouse model of sleep apnea. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress and inflammation are proposed to mediate kidney diseases that occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We examined the hypothesis that alpha-lipoic acid (LA) prevents renal injury in a mouse model of sleep apnea. METHODS: Twenty male mice received either intermittent hypoxia (IH) or intermittent air (IA) with or without a LA-enriched diet for 60 days. Plasma and urine samples were collected at the end of study, and kidneys were harvested for protein analysis. RESULTS: Animals in the IH + LA group had lower levels (p < 0.05) of plasma oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammation (TNF-alpha). Renal oxidative stress was also reduced in mice in the IH + LA (p < 0.05) compared with IH-exposed mice that were fed regular diet. Renal cellular apoptosis and tubular injury were reduced in the IH + LA group. Treatment with LA attenuated IH-induced glomerular hypertrophy and increased albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with LA prevents IH-induced renal injury in mice. LA may be a potential therapy for reducing renal dysfunction in patients with OSA. LA can also increase oxidative stress in healthy animals. 

Effectiveness of a continuing education course in local anesthesia for dental hygienists. 
The knowledge, skill level, and clinical practice habits of 97 dental hygienists were assessed after the hygienists completed a 24-hour continuing education course in local anesthesia. Three survey methods were used to assess changes: a written pretest/posttest, self-reports, and employer-reported behavior change. The self-report was completed prior to the course and again one month and six months after completion of the course. The dentists/employers completed the survey after six months. Data were analyzed by paired t-tests. There was a significant improvement in knowledge between the pretest and posttest, an increase in the number of dental hygienists administering local anesthesia, and an increased frequency of its use in the practice setting at both one and six months after the course. The majority of the dentists/employers stated that completion of the course by the dental hygienists had a positive impact on their practices as demonstrated by the practice running more smoothly, improved quality of dental hygiene services, more satisfied patients, and increased productivity of the dental hygienists. 

Characteristics of DSM-IV and ICD-10 cannabis dependence among Australian adults: results from the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. 
A representative sample (n = 10641) of Australian adults completed a structured diagnostic interview assessing the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders in the last year. The prevalence of DSM-IV (1.5%) and ICD-10 (1.7%) cannabis dependence was similar. DSM-IV and ICD-10 dependence criteria comprised unidimensional syndromes. The most common symptoms among dependent and non-dependent users were difficulties with controlling use and withdrawal, although there were marked differences in symptom prevalence. Dependent users reported a median of four symptoms. There was good to excellent diagnostic concordance (kappas = 0.7-0.9) between systems for dependence but not for abuse/harmful use (Y = 0.4). These findings provide some support for the validity of cannabis dependence. 

Development and initial validation of the White Bear Suppression Inventory (Smoking Version). 
INTRODUCTION: Thought suppression can produce a paradoxical rebound in unwanted cognition. Although interest in the role of suppression in nicotine dependence is growing quickly, a validated measure specifically assessing suppression of smoking-related thoughts does not exist. The present study describes the development of the White Bear Suppression Inventory-Smoking Version (WBSI-S). METHOD: The WBSI-S, in vivo monitoring of avoidance, and several other measures were completed as a part of a larger study on smoking cessation. Participants (N = 172) completed measures either during (n = 83) or preceding a smoking cessation attempt. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure for the WBSI-S, which was consistent across experimental groups. Both the Intrusive Smoking-related Thoughts and Thought Suppression subscales showed strong internal consistency. The Suppression subscale showed good convergent and discriminant validity; the Intrusion subscale demonstrated equivocal discrimination from other constructs. Participants completing the measure during a quit attempt reported higher self-reported suppression of thoughts about smoking than did continuing smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results support the construct validity of the suppression subscale and emphasize the importance of assessing suppression independently from intrusion. 

Menthol preference among smokers: association with TRPA1 variants. 
INTRODUCTION: Preference for smoking menthol cigarettes differs from individual to individual and population to population in ways that may provide higher levels of nicotine intake and contribute to smoking's morbidity and mortality. Menthol acts at sites that include the transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 channel that is expressed by nociceptors in the lung and airways, suggesting that individual and population differences in TRPA1 sequences might contribute to observed differences in menthol preference among smokers. METHODS: We have thus sought association between menthol preference and common variants in the TRPA1 gene in heavier and lighter European-American smokers. Smokers were recruited for studies of smoking cessation in North Carolina and of substance abuse genetics in Maryland. RESULTS: A common TRPA1 haplotype is defined by 1 missense and 10 intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms that display significant (.006 < p < .05; chi(2)) association with preference for mentholated cigarettes in heavy smokers (odds ratio ca. 1.3). There are smaller trends in the same direction in lighter smokers. CONCLUSIONS: This TRPA1 haplotype provides a novel biological basis for individual differences in menthol preference and possibly for actions of other agents that act at TRPA1. 

Polyvictimization and Psychological Distress in Early Adolescence: A Mediation Model of Defense Mechanisms and Coping Styles. 
In the current study, we aim to examine the link between exposure to multiple traumatic events (polyvictimization), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS), and psychiatric symptomatology in early adolescence. Furthermore, we aim to explore the mediating roles of defense styles and coping styles in the associations between polyvictimization, PTSS, and psychiatric symptomatology. Data from a Danish national representative sample of 390 eighth-grade students with a mean age of 13.95 (SD = 0.37) years were used. Participants responded to validated self-report questionnaires in 2001. The dimensions of immature defense styles and emotional and avoidance coping mediated the positive associations between polyvictimization, PTSS, and psychiatric symptomatology. Serial multiple mediation indicated that the sum of exposure to traumatic events was significantly associated with more immature defense styles, associated with both high levels emotional and avoidance coping, which, in turn, were associated with high levels of PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology. Polyvictimization is related to adverse outcomes in early adolescence. Both immature defense styles and emotional and avoidance coping styles should be considered as risk factors for the development of psychological distress following exposure to multiple traumas. 

Uncivil Reactions to Sexual Assault Online: Linguistic Features of News Reports Predict Discourse Incivility. 
Reports of sexual assault have been found to elicit online discourse incivility. The present study employs a computerized coding tool to examine linguistic characteristics of news media that are likely to influence discourse incivility-specifically, negative emotion, disagreement, and discussion about power relations. Additionally, machine learning was harnessed to measure the levels of comment toxicity, insult, profanity, threat, and identity attack in Reddit and Twitter posts sharing news reports of sexual assault. Findings reveal that linguistic features of news articles interact with platform community norms to predict rape culture as expressed within online responses to reports of sexual assault. 

Cognitive function during low-intensity walking: a test of the treadmill workstation. 
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of walking at self-selected speed on an active workstation on cognitive performance. METHODS: Sixty-six participants (n = 27 males, 39 females; mean age = 21.06 +/- 1.6 years) completed a treadmill-desk walking and a seated control condition, separated by 48 hours. During each condition, participants completed computerized versions of the Stroop test, a modified flanker task, and a test of reading comprehension. RESULTS: No significant differences in response speed or accuracy were found between walking and sitting conditions for any the cognitive tests. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that performance on cognitive tasks, including executive control processes, are not impaired by walking on an active workstation. Implementing active workstations into offices and classrooms may help to decrease sedentariness without impairing task performance. 

Spray charging of droplets in a wet scrubber. 
The experimental setup was designed to study the effect of natural charging of droplets during spraying (called spray electrification or spray charging) in a wet scrubber. The influence of nozzle material, liquid feed rate, and liquid composition on the specific charge (charge per unit volume of liquid) formed in spraying was measured. It was found that the nozzle material has no measurable effect on this specific charge. Increasing the liquid feed rate increases the specific charge significantly. Increasing solute (NaCl or NaOH) concentration increases the conductivity that decreases the formed specific charge. The same correlation between the specific charge and conductivity was also observed with real scrubbing liquids. It is proposed that the specific charge depends only on the value of liquid conductivity, not on liquid composition. The conductivity of the tested scrubbing liquids was high enough to suppress the formation of a high specific charge during spraying. 

Sleep physiology predicts memory retention after reactivation. 
Both sleep and future relevance influence memory consolidation; however, limited research has investigated their role in memory reconsolidation. We manipulated the future relevance of both stable and labile memories in need of reconsolidation. Two groups learned two blocks of syllable pairs on one evening and were told they would be tested on one of the blocks later. On the second evening, one group (Labile) received reminders designed to return their memories of syllable pairs to a labile state, while a second group (Stable) received reminders designed to leave these memories in a stable state. No significant differences in memory retention were found between blocks or groups the following morning. Frontal delta (0.5-4 Hz) electroencephalographic power during Stage 2 sleep correlated positively with retention of future-relevant material exclusively in the Labile group. Central theta (4-8 Hz) electroencephalographic power during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep correlated positively with the extent to which the Labile group selectively retained future-relevant material. These relationships suggest that sleep-dependent processes are involved in an economical reprocessing of memories beyond the initial stages of consolidation. 

Inactivated periods of constant orthodontic forces related to desirable tooth movement in rats. 
AIM: To examine the effects of inactive periods of force on the amount of tooth displacement and root resorption during experimental tooth movement in rats. SAMPLE: Sixty 11-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. METHOD: The maxillary first molar (M1) was moved mesially using a removable titanium-nickel alloy closed coil spring for 14 days. The rats were divided into four groups with, 0, 1, 4, and 9 hours of inactivation per day. RESULTS: Tooth displacement in the 0- and 1-hour groups was significantly greater than that in the 9-hour group. The area of root resorption in the 4- and 9-hour groups was significantly less than that in the 0- and 1-hour groups. There was no significant difference in root resorption between 0- and 1-hour groups, and also between 4- and 9-hour groups. CONCLUSION: The distance of tooth displacement gradually decreased as the inactive period increased, whereas root resorption suddenly decreased between 1 and 4 hours of inactive orthodontic force. 

Effectiveness of Prison-Based Exercise Training Programs: A Systematic Review. 
BACKGROUND: The promotion of physical activity among imprisoned people is a public health strategy that could help to improve the health status of this collective. This systematic review is aimed at reviewing the scientific evidence regarding the effects of exercise training programs performed by inmates. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials aimed at identifying the characteristics and effects of prison-based exercise training programs on imprisoned people was carried through MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus. RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized controlled studies were selected, and the methodological quality of these was acceptable according to the Downs and Black scale. The proposed interventions were mainly based on the performance of aerobic or combined exercise training programs. Generally, the participants were healthy men who were imprisoned for at least 2 months and up to 15 years. Ten out of the 11 studies reported significant changes on physical and mental health-related variables, after the intervention took place. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that prison-based exercise programs constitute a feasible and useful strategy for improving the physical and mental health status of prisoners. 

Dislocated intrauterine devices: clinical presentations, diagnosis and management. 
OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are globally one of the most popular methods of contraception. Uterine perforation is one of the most significant complications of IUD use and commonly occurs at the time of IUD insertion rather than presenting as delayed migration. This paper reports a series of 13 cases of displaced IUDs requiring retrieval by laparoscopy or laparotomy. All the IUDs were copper bearing and most perforations occurred immediately after IUD insertion. CASES: In two patients with sigmoid colon injury and IUD penetration of the appendix, laparoscopic management had failed and laparotomy was necessary owing to severe obliteration of the pelvic cavity. In one patient laparotomy was the preferred surgical approach owing to acute bowel perforation. In the remaining patients, the displaced devices were successfully removed by laparoscopy. CONCLUSION: Uterine perforation and IUD migration to the organs in the abdominopelvic cavity are serious complications of IUD insertion and can be successfully managed by laparoscopy, or by laparotomy in the presence of severe pelvic adhesions or unexpected complications. 

Denicotinized versus average nicotine tobacco cigarette smoking differentially releases striatal dopamine. 
INTRODUCTION: Nicotine has long been recognized as a necessary but insufficient component of tobacco cigarettes to maintain a psychophysiological need to smoke. This study examined venous plasma concentrations effects of nicotine in cigarette smoking after overnight abstinence to release striatal dopamine (DA). METHODS: Twenty-two male smokers smoked either denicotinized (denic) or average nicotine (nic) cigarettes under single blind conditions. Each was given [(11)C]raclopride and scanned in a positron emission tomography (PET) facility. RESULTS: Smoking either denic or nic cigarettes released striatal DA. Denic cigarette smoking released DA primarily in the right striatum, whereas nic cigarette smoking released DA in both striata, but especially in the left. Increases in venous plasma nicotine concentrations correlated positively with increased DA release in the left caudate nucleus. Smoking denic cigarettes reduced craving as much as smoking nic cigarettes. Craving reduction after nic tobacco smoking correlated with increases in plasma nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Nonnicotine factors in tobacco smoking produce important right brain effects. Nicotine is a pharmacological factor during tobacco smoking that releases bilateral striatal DA, but more in the left brain. 

Destabilization in self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process is associated with better treatment outcome in patients with mood disorders. 
Objective: While destabilization periods characterized by high variability and turbulence in a patient's psychological state might seem obstructive for psychotherapy, a complex systems approach to psychopathology predicts that these periods are actually beneficial as they indicate possibilities for reorganization within the patient. The present study tested the hypothesis that destabilization is related to better treatment outcome.Method: 328 patients who received psychotherapy for mood disorders completed daily self-ratings about their psychotherapeutic process. A continuous measure of destabilization was defined as the relative strength of the highest peak in dynamic complexity, a measure for variability and turbulence, in the self-ratings of individual patients.Results: Destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome. When improvers and non-improvers were analyzed separately, destabilization was found to be related to better treatment outcome in improvers but not in non-improvers.Conclusions: Destabilization in daily self-ratings of the psychotherapeutic process is associated with better treatment outcome. The identification of destabilization periods in process-monitoring data is clinically relevant. During destabilization, patients are believed to be increasingly sensitive to the effects of therapy. Clinicians could tailor their interventions to these sensitive periods. 

Day-to-day variability of physical activity of older adults living in the community. 
The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a 24-hr recording period is sufficient to describe physical activity (PA) of 1 week for intraindividual comparison in older adults. Furthermore, the authors analyzed whether physical performance can be used as a surrogate marker of PA. PA was captured on 7 consecutive days by a body-fixed sensor in 44 community-dwelling older adults (80.75 +/- 4.05 yr). Mean times of walking and of "time on feet" of the group were 10.2 hr (+/- 3.5) and 35.1 hr (+/- 9.43), respectively. Intraindividual variabilities of walking and of time on feet were 31.9% +/- 10.79% and 19.4% +/- 8.76%, respectively. Accumulated time of variables of PA showed no differences between weekdays, with variabilities of 3.8% and 1.8% for walking and time on feet, respectively. Association between Short Physical Performance Battery and PA was limited (walking r = .397, time on feet r = .41). 

Absorption of color additives and settling volume in water of blue-green alga, ishikurage (Nostoc commune). 
The properties of ishikurage (Nostoc commune) and other algae were compared. Ishikurage and suizenji nori (Aphanothece sacrum) absorbed much more amaranth than others. They have a high settling volume (SV) in water. The high SV of ishikurage is attributable to its neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The acid detergent fiber (ADF) from the alga had a high amaranth absorption. However the absorption by the ADF did not explain the absorption by ishikurage. The results suggest that ishikurage may have a nutritional significance as a source of dietary fiber. 

Brain activity during anticipation of smoking-related and emotionally positive pictures in smokers and nonsmokers: a new measure of cue reactivity. 
Previous studies have shown that a brain wave pattern known as stimulus preceding negativity (SPN) can index the anticipation of motivationally relevant events. The present study was the first to use SPN as an index of the motivational significance of smoking-related pictures. Emotionally positive and neutral pictures served as controls. The paradigm involved the following sequence: (a) presentation of a picture (S1) for 500 ms, (b) a fixation cross for 3,500 ms, (c) a second presentation (S2) of the same picture for 2,000 ms, and (d) another fixation cross signifying the beginning of a new S1-S2 trial using a different picture. The participants (N = 24, half smokers and half nonsmokers) viewed pictures from three categories (smoking-related, emotionally positive, or emotionally neutral). Consistent with predictions, smokers exhibited significantly greater mean SPN amplitudes in anticipation of smoking-related pictures relative to neutral pictures. Among nonsmokers the SPN was significantly smaller in anticipation of smoking pictures compared with neutral pictures. These findings are consistent with the incentive sensitization theory of addiction and other conditioning and cue-reactivity models. 

Father's and mother's psychological violence and adolescent behavioral adjustment. 
Maternal and paternal psychological violence were examined as potential risk factors for internalized and externalized behavior problems displayed by adolescents. Childhood family violence (physical and psychological parental violence), current extrafamily violence (bullying and dating violence), and family structure were taken into account. A sample of 278 adolescents (mean age: 14.2) were recruited in three public schools located in low to high socioeconomic areas. Participants were in the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades, and each completed a self-administered questionnaire. Frequency of current psychological violence is about the same for each parental figure. The three most frequent and least frequent psychologically violent parental practices were also the same for both parental figures. Psychological violence of both parents was related to internalized and externalized behavior problems over and above family structure, childhood family violence, and current extrafamily violence. 

The impact of the 2006 Scottish smoke-free legislation on sales of nicotine replacement therapy. 
This study used over-the-counter (OTC) sales of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to investigate the impact of the introduction of smoke-free legislation in Scotland in March 2006 on smoking cessation behaviour. The time series of NRT sales (units and value) in Scotland from 2004 to 2006 were compared with the same period for the rest of the UK, and analysed using an ARIMA time series model. There was a significant increase in units and value of NRT sales in Scotland in the first 6 months of 2006 (p< or =0.001), apparent from January and prior to the introduction of the smoking ban, with no comparable increase for the rest of the UK. There was no significant increase in NRT sales for the second half of 2006. These data suggest an increase in smoking cessation behaviour in the period immediately before the introduction of smoke-free legislation, but this was not sustained beyond the first few months of the post-legislation period. 

Change in frequency of the maxillary midline diastema appearing in photographs of Caucasian females in two fashion magazines from 2003 to 2012. 
OBJECTIVES: To ascertain if there has been a change in the frequency of appearance of maxillary midline diastema in two leading women's fashion magazines over a decade. METHODS: Two observers counted the frequency of maxillary midline diastema that appeared in Caucasian female models featured in British Vogue and Glamour (UK). RESULTS: An increase in the frequency of maxillary midline diastema appearing in both publications was observed between 2003 and 2012. CONCLUSIONS: This change may indicate an increase in the acceptance of the maxillary midline diastema, which may in turn, influence orthodontic and aesthetic dentistry treatment planning. 

Home smoking restrictions and adolescent smoking. 
The prevention of adolescent smoking has focused on peer influences to the relative neglect of parental influences. Parents socialize their children about many behaviors including smoking, and parental rules about their child's smoking have been related to lower levels of adolescent smoking. Moreover, among adults, indoor smoking restrictions have been associated with decreased smoking. Accordingly, the current study tested the relation of adolescent smoking to home smoking policy (rules regulating where adults are allowed to smoke in the home). Results showed that restrictive home smoking policies were associated with lower likelihood of trying smoking for both middle and high school students. However, for high school students this relation was restricted to homes with non-smoking parents. Home smoking policies were not associated with current regular smoking for either middle or high school students. Home smoking policies may be useful in preventing adolescent smoking experimentation, although longitudinal and experimental research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. 

The Effect of Pre-Post Differences in Walking, Health, and Weight on Retirees' Long-Term Quality of Life. 
This research examined the effect of pre-post differences in walking duration, health, and weight on retirees' long-term quality of life (QoL). It used data from a 2018 randomized mail survey of 483 suburban New Jersey retirees. Ordinary least squares and three-stage least squares models were used. The analysis showed that changes in walking duration during the first 2 years of retirement are directly associated with health change, health change has an effect on long-term QoL, and weight variation of 10 lb or more has an effect on health change and long-term QoL. Although QoL peaks for the sample of retirees at around age 75, people whose average walking duration increased, health improved, and weight did not increase substantially after retirement continued to experience high QoL for a longer time. The results show that people can achieve high long-term QoL by choosing an active lifestyle when transitioning to retirement. 

Effects of altitude on mood, behaviour and cognitive functioning. A review. 
Alterations in psychological mood, personality, behaviour and cognitive functioning associated with altitude have been recognised for many years. Psychological and behavioural changes resulting from the effects of hypoxia often include increases in euphoria, irritability, hostility and impairment of neuropsychological functions such as vision and memory. There is limited research to indicate that some decrements may persist for up to a year, or longer, after return to lower elevation. However, generalisations of the effects of altitude on mood, behaviour and cognitive function are complicated by differences between studies including the specific tasks or dimensions measured, methods of measurement, degree of altitude, duration of exposure and types of participants. There also appear to be wide individual differences in the response to altitude sojourns. Investigations designed to measure symptoms and mood changes during actual mountain climbs are needed, since most of the systematic research has been conducted in altitude chambers. The extent to which these simulations can be generalised to actual altitude settings remains to be documented. 

Real-world vehicle emissions: a summary of the Seventeenth Coordinating Research Council On-Road Vehicle Emissions Workshop. 
The Coordinating Research Council, Inc. (CRC) held its 17th On-Road Vehicle Emissions Workshop in March 2007, where results of the most recent on-road vehicle emissions research were presented. We summarize ongoing work from researchers who are engaged in improving our understanding of the role and contribution of mobile sources to ambient air quality and emission inventories. Participants in the Workshop discussed efforts to improve mobile source emission models, light- and heavy-duty vehicle emissions measurements, on- and off-road emissions measurements, effects of fuels and lubricating oils on emissions, as well as emerging issues and topics for future research. 

Potentials of biodegraded cashew pomace for cake baking. 
The use of biodegraded cashew pomace processed into flour for cake baking was investigated. The physico-chemical changes during the submerged fermentation of the pomace and the organoleptic qualities of the composite cake were also monitored. There was an increase of about 50% in protein content of the pomace after 96 h of fermentation. However, a reduction of about 61% in the total microbial count after 24 h was due to the toxic effect of the organic acids on the microbial cells during fermentation. The cashew flour had high crude fibre (ca. 20-33%) and carbohydrate (ca. 16-47%) values. The composite cake made from a 10:90 combination of 96 h-degraded cashew flour/wheat flour respectively was the most accepted. The cake which had a specific volume of 0.53 ml/g lost 11.1% moisture when 38 g of its batter was exposed to 190 degrees C for 10 minutes. This cake had a calorie value of 293.8/100 g and may be useful in feeding diabetic patients who require low carbohydrate foods. 

Determination of observer-rated alpha activity during sleep. 
Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been described as having alpha intrusion into sleep. In a separate study of the relationship between depression and CFS, we investigated the sleep of CFS patients. We could not detect any observable alpha anomaly in our group of CFS patients. It is possible that there is a subgroup of CFS patients in whom no alpha anomaly is present. However, the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) montage used in our study was different to that employed by previous researchers. This paper investigates the influence of electrode derivations on the outcome of observable alpha ratings. We compared simultaneous recordings of sleep EEG using three commonly employed montages. Our results indicate that use of the mastoid reference (montage 1) results in the highest observer-related alpha. This may suggest that data regarding alpha intrusion should always be collected using montage 1. However, there is a possibility that the mastoid electrode is not electrically silent and is contaminating the data of the referenced channels. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the validity of alpha intrusion measurement of CFS and fibromyalgia. 

Cortical and Subcortical Brain Changes in Children and Adolescents With Narcolepsy Type 1. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES: Neuroimaging studies on structural alterations in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) have shown controversial and heterogeneous results. The purpose of this study was to investigate microstructural brain changes in patients with NT1 close to disease onset. METHODS: We examined cortical and subcortical grey matter volumes in 20 drug-naive children and adolescents with NT1 compared with 19 healthy controls; whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, shape and volumetric analyses, and cortical thickness analysis were used. RESULTS: When compared with controls, NT1 patients revealed reduced grey matter volume in cerebellum and medial prefrontal cortex and increased volume in right hippocampus. Cortical thickness in frontal lobe was also reduced in patients compared with controls. Increased volume and shape expansion in right hippocampus in patients compared with controls were also confirmed by both vertex and volumetric analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that subtle structural brain changes involving attentional and limbic circuits are detectable in children and adolescents with NT1. Cerebellum involvement might be related to the childhood NT1 clinical phenotype. 

Sexually harassing behavior against adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh: implications for achieving millennium development goals. 
This study examines the extent and type of sexually harassing behavior or intimidations unmarried adolescent girls experienced on their way to school, college or social visits and type of perpetrators in victims' view in rural Bangladesh using data of the 2004 National Nutrition Programme baseline survey. The survey collected self-reported data on sexual harassments of 5,106 girls aged 13-19 years selected randomly. Results reveal that gendered harassments were experienced by 35% of the girls, unwanted sexual attentions by 34%, and sexual intimidations by 14%, yielding prevalence of sexual harassments of any type 43%. Higher girls' education and household economic status heightened their risks of being harassed. Perpetrators were male young spoilt bullies (64%), neighborhood youths (30%), students (22%) and hoodlums (6%). High prevalence of sexual harassments mirrors vulnerability of adolescent girls in the community and deserves to be tackled to achieve millennium development goals (MDGs) in gender equality in health and social development. 

Metaphors as contextual evidence for engaging Haitian clients in practice: a case study. 
Haitian immigrants remain underserved in the United States (U.S.), despite their large presence and their visibility, which increased after the January 12, 2010 earthquake. Employing cultural-specific practice strategies to engage Haitians in the U.S. who experienced loss in their social networks, requires understanding the context of their ecological culture and consideration of relevant linguistic and cultural elements. Through a case example, we describe the use of metaphors in cultural language as part of a strategy used to engage a Haitian immigrant with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Outcomes indicate that the use of storytelling and metaphors facilitate disclosure of clients' worldviews, experiences, feelings and hopes in a safe environment while providing them with tools to determine progress. We identify four practice guidelines for intervention strategies with ethnic minority groups who share similar cultural contexts. Metaphors, which are a viable approach to practice, focus on cultural strengths and resiliencies over traditional models of deficit and can enhance access to needed effective services for underserved populations, such as Haitians in the United States. 

Dental disease preventive programs in a rural Appalachian population. 
The objective of the dental disease prevention and early intervention program at Youngstown State University is to 1) educate future dental hygienists on the provision of primary care in a non-traditional dental care setting and 2) provide access to preventive and simple restorative care for an underserved rural Appalachian population. Through their education in dental public health courses, students are prepared to provide preventive oral healthcare services to underserved populations in non-traditional clinical settings. Senior dental hygiene students in the dental public health course sequence work in pairs, along with a supervising dentist using a mobile dental unit at the Child and Family Health Services Clinic in Lisbon, Ohio. Ninety-eight hours of preventive oral health services and simple restorative care were provided in 1996. Student evaluations of the overall extramural clinical experience were positive. The program is an example of a collaborative community-based approach to meet the oral health needs of low-income families. 

Clinical photographs--the gold standard. 
This survey was carried out to allow a minimum data set required for intra- and extra-oral photographs to be established. In 1999 a questionnaire was sent to members of the Angle Society of Europe to establish their current clinical practice with regard to extra- and intra-oral photography. The Angle Society was chosen because of their stated commitment to a high standard of record keeping and of clinical care. Results showed that a full series of extra- and intra-oral photographs were taken both before and after treatment, as well as stage photographs during treatment on many cases. The need for each of these photographs will be discussed in some detail, and recommendations will be made as to what would be considered the Gold standard before, during, and after a course of orthodontic treatment. 

The relationship between daytime exposure to light and night-time sleep in 6-12-week-old infants. 
This project investigated the relationship between exposure to light and 24-h patterns of sleep and crying in young, healthy, full-term babies living at home and following a normal domestic routine. Measures included an ankle worn activity monitor, an external light monitor and the Barr Baby Day Diary in which parents recorded periods of sleep, crying, feeding and other behaviours at 5-min intervals throughout the 24-h period. Fifty-six babies (26 males and 30 females) were monitored across three consecutive days at 6, 9 and 12 weeks of age. There was an early evening peak in crying which was associated with reduced sleep at 6 weeks. Across the trials there was a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of sleep occurring at night. Sleeping well at 6 weeks was a good indication of more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks. Babies who slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in the early afternoon period. These data suggest that light in the normal domestic setting influences the development of the circadian system. 

The efficacy of evidence-based psychotherapies versus usual care for youths: controlling confounds in a meta-reanalysis. 
In the present meta-analysis, the authors examined how several confounding moderator variables may relate to the advantage of evidence-based psychological treatments (EBTs) over usual care (UC) in the treatment of youths, including the extent to which each therapy was bona fide, supervision provided to therapists, therapist caseload, whether EBT was provided by research therapists, and whether specialized training was provided for EBT therapists. When comparing EBT with bona fide UC while controlling for each confound individually, the advantage for EBT was small and nearly always statistically nonsignificant. Additionally, an increasing total number of confounds favoring EBT was significantly predictive of a greater effect size advantage for EBT. The superior efficacy of EBTs for youths may be an artifact of confounded research designs. 

Time-limited group psychotherapy. 
The presence of a time limit shapes the entire therapeutic process and culminates in the management of termination. This paper outlines a protocol for dealing with termination in time-limited psychotherapy groups: (1) Select suitable members with similar capacity to use a time-limited format; (2) use a closed group format; (3) clarify the time boundaries at the beginning; (4) reinforce the time frame during the last half of the group; (5) provide focused interventions; (6) forestall premature termination; (7) reinforce termination themes of deprivation, resentment and anger, rejection, grief and loss, responsibility for self; (8) structure the final session; and (9) plan a 4-month follow-up visit to encourage ongoing application. These guidelines provide the therapist with a general structure to ensure that major termination themes are systematically addressed. They deal with powerful concepts of maturation and self-responsibility and incorporate the principal strategies that distinguish time-limited from time-unlimited group psychotherapy. 

A psychotherapy researcher's perspective on therapist self-awareness and self-focused attention after a decade of research. 
In this Early Career Award paper, the interplay between quantitative and qualitative approaches to self-awareness in the psychotherapy literature is described. In addition, the linkages between therapist self-awareness and self-focused attention discussed in the cognitive and social psychology literatures are also addressed. Contradictory sets of findings are examined; for example, momentary states of therapist self-awareness have at times been associated with anxiety or poor performance and at other times with positive interpersonal processes and client perceptions. Some of the studies on the management of distracting self-awareness are also reviewed, and suggestions for future research in the areas of mindfulness, attentional flexibility, and the person of the therapist are provided. 

Daily walking in older adults: day-to-day variability and criterion-referenced validity of total daily step counts. 
OBJECTIVE: To determine the day-to-day variability of older adults' physical activity, and to evaluate the accuracy of the 10,000-step goal for classifying whether older adults obtain 30 minutes of MVPA. METHODS: Ninety-one adults of age over 60 years of age wore a Yamax pedometer and Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days. Interday reliability was estimated via two-way ANOVA ICCs, and classification accuracy was evaluated via sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Interday reliability was high; 4 of 5 outcome measures had a reliability of > or = .80 with only 2 days of data. The 10,000-step cut point had high accuracy for identifying days with less than 30 minutes of MVPA, but poor accuracy for identifying days with more than 30 minutes of MVPA. CONCLUSIONS: Day-to-day variability in physical activity is lower in older adults than other age groups. The 10,000-step goal is inadequate for determining whether daily physical activity includes 30 minutes of MVPA in this population. 

SCAN: a method of community collaboration. 
Recent research has highlighted the complexity of the battered child syndrome. Clinical experience suggests that treatment of troubled families is a long-term process, draining financial resources of agencies and emotional resources of professionals. The need to provide support and case consultation to professionals working in the area of child abuse and neglect evolved in the establishment, in 1968, of the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect (SCAN) Program at Children's Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This program provides an effective method of intervention through identification, consultation, referral and follow-up of at-risk families. Weekly meetings offer multi-disciplinary case coordination, treatment recommendations, and a channel of communication for representatives of community agencies. This paper traces the history and present status of the SCAN Program, as well as the role of SCAN as a force for change of community attitudes. 

JAKOB narrative analysis: the psychodynamic conflict as a narrative model. 
When a patient tells a story during psychotherapy sessions, it is both a mutual interaction between patient and therapist and a presentation of personal experience. The patient calls up and re-creates a biographical occurrence and puts it before a listener for viewing, enacting it verbally in the perspective of wish fulfillment and anxiety coping. JAKOB narrative analysis, situated in the field of psychoanalytical and narrative analytical research, is an encoding-supported qualitative instrument for the systematic reconstruction of verbal everyday narratives in the context of psychotherapeutic processes. In this study, the JAKOB narrative analysis is described in detail with the aid of an example narrative, put in relation to the therapeutic process, and discussed critically from a methodological viewpoint. 

Not only limbs in atypical restless legs syndrome. 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) typically affects the limbs, but the involvement of other body parts has also been reported. In this essay, we critically review all literature reports of atypical RLS cases with unusual localizations. Applying the updated diagnostic criteria of the International restless legs syndrome study group (IRLSSG), which also consider symptoms localized outside of the lower limbs, a few of these atypical cases reported in the previous literature resulted in a definitive diagnosis of RLS. We also discuss the relationship between RLS and burning mouth syndrome (BMS) or restless genital syndrome (RGS). We conclude clinical sleep specialists should be aware of unusual RLS localizations because they respond to the usual treatment for RLS. All the IRLSSG diagnostic criteria should be applied in every suspected case, in order to establish a correct diagnosis of this disabling but treatable condition. 

Multiheaded mandibular condyles. 
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of multiheaded condyles (MHC) in a group of Turkish subjects using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). METHODS: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans of 975 patients (546 female, 429 male; age 15-89 years, mean age 42.46 years) who were referred to Istanbul University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Dentomaxillofacial Radiology between 2015 and 2021 were evaluated. Bifid and trifid mandibular condyle cases were analyzed according to the patients' age, gender, and laterality, and their frequencies were determined statistically. RESULTS: A multiheaded mandibular condyle (MHC) was detected in 57 of the 975 patients (546 female, 429 male). MHC was diagnosed unilaterally in 49 patients; in 8 patients, it was observed bilaterally. A bifid mandibular condyle (BMC) was detected in 54 patients. A trifid mandibular condyle (TMC) was found in 2 women, and one tetrafid mandibular condyle was seen in 1 woman. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MHC was 5.84% in our proband, which is higher than in previous studies. There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of MHC in males or females. 

Inhalation transfer factors for air pollution health risk assessment. 
To facilitate routine health risk assessments, we develop the concept of an inhalation transfer factor (ITF). The ITF is defined as the pollutant mass inhaled by an exposed individual per unit pollutant mass emitted from an air pollution source. A cumulative population inhalation transfer factor (PITF) is also defined to describe the total fraction of an emitted pollutant inhaled by all members of the exposed population. In this paper, ITFs and PITFs are calculated for outdoor releases from area, point, and line sources, indoor releases in single zone and multizone indoor environments, and releases within motor vehicles. Typical PITFs for an urban area from emissions outdoors are approximately 10(-6)-10(-3). PITFs associated with emissions in buildings or in moving vehicles are typically much higher, approximately 10(-3)-10(-1). 

Orbital fractures in sport: a review. 
Orbital fractures represent a small proportion of sports-related injuries in the US and abroad. However, the significant functional and cosmetic sequelae of such fractures warrant a comprehensive evaluation of any athlete sustaining facial trauma. Initial evaluation is directed at excluding neurological impairment or the presence of vision-threatening injury. Subsequent examination should ascertain the presence of signs and symptoms consistent with orbital fracture. These include gross bony deformity, limitation of gaze, diplopia and malposition of the globe. The presence of any of the aforementioned symptoms should prompt further investigation using computed tomography to corroborate or refute clinical suspicion. Orbital fracture mandates referral to an ophthalmologist or oculoplastic surgeon; initial management is dictated by the severity of functional symptoms, and may necessitate early surgical intervention. Those patients who are managed conservatively should return for frequent follow-up, as progressive diplopia, enophthalmos, or gaze limitation are indications for late operative repair. The majority of patients who sustain orbital fractures are able to return to sport, however, persistent diplopia is not uncommon, and may persist despite optimal treatment. 

Treatment with methotrexate of a cornual pregnancy following endometrial resection. 
OBJECTIVES: Endometrial resection is a procedure often performed for treatment of menorrhagia. Despite the fact that amenorrhoea frequently ensues, some normal endometrium can remain present and become the implantation site of a pregnancy. Such an event is uncommon (0.7%); however, the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is increased. This case report calls the reader's attention to the risk of intra- and extrauterine pregnancies and the necessity for contraception after endometrial resection, even in cases where amenorrhoea supervenes. CASE: A 46-year-old woman with prior endometrial resection and subsequent amenorrhoea, was diagnosed with a cornual pregnancy. She was successfully treated with systemic methotrexate, which was given in an outpatient clinic. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the increased likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy after endometrial resection. All women submitting to this procedure should be counselled about the need for contraception, even in cases where amenorrhoea develops. 

Dissociation and variability of adult attachment dimensions and early maladaptive schemas in sexual and violent offenders. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of constructs that may indicate the presence of disorganized attachment style in sexual and violent offenders. Constructs measured were dissociation, variability on self-report measures of attachment style and early maladaptive schemas, and variability in observed behavior. Data on variability was collected at four time intervals, approximately 3 weeks apart. No differences between the groups were found in variability of self-reported attachment style. Both offending groups showed greater variability in early schemas and higher levels of dissociation than the nonoffending group. Sex offenders showed greater variability than violent offenders in behaviors related to distress. 

Sensorimotor electroencephalogram rhythmic activity: a functional gate mechanism. 
Neurophysiological evidence for a negative feedback loop in somatosensory thalamic nuclei has provided a basis for understanding the origins of rhythmic activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of sensorimotor cortex. Studies reviewed here suggest that state-specific activation of this mechanism is responsible both for a variable pattern of rhythmic frequencies during wakefulness and the spindle burst pattern during sleep. It is proposed further that these rhythms index immobility and a common set of physiological changes in sensorimotor function, including reduced excitability in both afferent and efferent pathways. It is hypothesized, therefore, that the closing of a thalamic "inhibitory gate" is indicated by the occurrence of these rhythms. While a greater resolution of specific relationships is necessary, the study of these EEG patterns clearly provides a measure of complex physiological events in the nervous system, and can be also useful in identifying functional abnormalities. 

Atmospheric nitrogen compounds-issues related to agricultural systems. 
Workable pollution abatement policies and effective legislation must be based on sound science. However, despite many years of research, there are still uncertainties about the effects of atmospheric nitrogen compounds on crops and other vegetation. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the main compounds, focussing on the concentrations and combinations of pollutants that occur in rural areas. The sources, concentrations and effects of oxidised, reduced and organic nitrogen compounds are considered in turn, then the effects of deposited nitrogen on ecosystems are discussed. Research priorities on the effects of deposited nitrogen in Europe and the USA are compared. Finally, the review leads to a list of issues for discussion and recommendations for research. 

Stability of carotenoids and tocopherols in ready-to-eat baby-leaf lettuce and salad rocket during low-temperature storage. 
Minimally processed ready-to-eat baby-leaf vegetables (BLVs) are the most convenient source to include the health beneficial bioactive in the daily diet. In the present study, the visual quality and storage stability of carotenoids, tocopherols were investigated in lettuce (green and red romaine) and salad rocket BLVs. The commercially packed samples of BLVs were stored at 0 degreesC and 4 degreesC in dark conditions and analyzed after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 days of storage. All the studied samples were found in better visual quality up to eight days of storage at both the temperatures. In most cases, the quality was correlated with the chlorophyll contents. The highest significant (p < 0.05) positive changes in total carotenoids and tocopherols were observed in samples stored at 4 degreesC. Also, carotenoids and tocopherols are maximum stable in green and red romaine lettuce, respectively. 

Drug attitudes and discrimination between drugs among a group of English schoolchildren. 
This study investigates the attitudes of a group of 185 London schoolchildren towards a number of legal and illegal drugs, and examines the ways in which they discriminate between these drugs. Heroin and LSD were seen as the most dangerous drugs, and alcohol and cigarettes as the safest. Subjects who had a negative attitude towards drugs in general regarded cannabis, amphetamines, alcohol and tobacco as more dangerous than subjects with a neutral or pro-drug attitude. There was also a sex difference: boys claimed to know more about drugs, were more likely to know a cannabis user and to have been "really drunk" than the girls. The implications of these results for drug and alcohol education programmes are discussed. 

Alternate rapid maxillary expansion-constriction and tooth-borne symphyseal distraction osteogenesis : A case report demonstrating treatment of a patient with severe crowding. 
Surgically assisted rapid mandibular expansion is a contemporary treatment alternative to enable genuine skeletal mandibular widening. Mandibular widening via a tooth-borne distractor is a practical and noninvasive clinical approach. Recently, to expand and protract the maxilla, the alternate rapid maxillary expansion-and-constriction procedure was suggested. In this case report, we describe a female patient (12 years 7 months old) having severe maxillary and mandibular crowding who underwent repeated alternate rapid maxillary expansion and constriction in combination with tooth-borne symphyseal distraction osteogenesis. 

Food, water and ethanol consumption by rats under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. 
Rats could lever press 24 hours a day for 97 mg food pellets under a fixed-interval (FI) 90 second schedule. During the first 4 days, an ethanol solution was the only available fluid, after which both water and ethanol solutions were available. At ethanol concentrations (w/v) of 5%, 7.5% and l0%, total caloric intake and total fluid intake remained constant, while ethanol consumption was inversely proportional to the concentration of the solution. When the FI 90s schedule was changed to FI 45 s, or to FI 180 s, there were only small changes in total caloric intake, total fluid intake and in percentages of total fluid consumption and total caloric intake as ethanol. The data suggest that the intake of ethanol under this fixed-interval schedule depends more on the ethanol concentration than on the calories obtained from ethanol drinking. 

Physical and sexual abuse in runaway youths. 
This paper examines the extent of physical and sexual abuse among runaway youths and the association of that abuse with behavior, mental health, life events, and parental mental health. Of 291 youths who sought shelter at homes for runaway youths, almost half (141) reported a history of physical or sexual abuse. The results emphasize the need that these abused youths and their parents have for mental health services: One in five of the nonabused youths and one in three of the abused youths endorsed parental descriptions reflective of antisocial personality and/or drug problems, and runaways who were abused had a mean level of behavior problems in the clinically significant area. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that the simple existence of physical or sexual abuse impacts on self-esteem and overall behavior problems regardless of other family problems. 

Religion and attitudes towards alcohol use in the Western Isles. 
Research on religion and alcohol has produced conclusive results with regard to the relationship between religion and alcohol consumption but ambiguous findings with regard to more general attitudes towards alcohol use. This paper considers these issues in depth by a secondary analysis of data collected in the Western Isles of Scotland. It finds that differences between Protestants and Catholics do exist: Protestants are more likely to endorse an abstinent position, while Catholics are more permissive in their attitudes towards drinking. In terms of attitudes towards drunkenness, however, differences between the two groups are slight. The paper concludes by giving data on differences in attitudes towards alcoholism and service use and calls for future studies in the area to take the cultural context of these issues into account. 

Orthodontic treatment and temporomandibular disorder: is there a relationship? Part 2: Clinical implications. 
Although a review of the current literature does not reveal compelling evidence for the claim that orthodontic treatment prevents, causes, or cures temporomandibular disorders (TMD), the currently available clinical studies devoted to this topic share some methodological weaknesses, some of which are discussed in the present article. Another purpose of this paper is to extend the current understanding about the relationship between orthodontics and TMD to situations occurring in routine clinical practice. By doing so, we provide suggestions that are intended to help the orthodontist in decision-making when he or she deals with a patient who is in need of orthodontic treatment for dental or skeletal reasons, but has a history of TMD, or who develops TMD signs and symptoms during or after treatment. 

Why do psychotherapists participate in psychotherapy research and why not? Results of the Attitudes to Psychotherapy Research Questionnaire with a sample of experienced German psychotherapists. 
OBJECTIVE: Psychotherapy research needs to convince psychotherapists to contribute their time and effort to participate. The present paper describes the development and first results of the Attitudes to Psychotherapy Research Questionnaire (APRQ). METHOD: The APRQ and additional qualitative questions about exclusion criteria for participation were filled out by a sample of 365 therapists (psychoanalytic, psychodynamic, and cognitive-behavioral) during an Internet-based research survey. RESULTS: A principle component analysis yielded six factors: Benefits, Damage, Legitimation, Self-doubt, Effectiveness Doubt and External Reasons. Age, external reasons and benefits predicted willingness to participate independent of therapeutic school. DISCUSSION: Results show a changing trend to more positive attitudes to psychotherapy research. To be willing to participate in future research, therapists expected high quality designs, financial compensation, and personal gains. 

The capture of heavy metals from incineration using a spray dryer integrated with a fabric filter using various additives. 
This study investigated the effects of feedstock additives [polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and NaCl] and spray dryer additives (SiO2, CaCl2, NaHCO3) on heavy metal and fly ash removal efficiencies, and on particle size distribution of heavy metals. A spray dryer with an integrated fabric filter was used as an air pollution control device (APCD). Removal efficiencies for fly ash and heavy metals were greater than 95 and 90%, respectively. When additives of PVC or NaCl were used, the concentration of heavy metals distributed in fly ash apparently varied when the particle diameter was <1 microm. Although the effects of the additives SiO2, CaCl2, and NaHCO3 on the elemental size distribution of Cr were insignificant, these additives did slightly increase concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Pb partitioning in coarser particles (>1 microm). 

Effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep in the healthy population: Interpretations from the serotonergic pathway. 
Vitamin D insufficiency is common in the healthy population. Recent insights addressed the role of vitamin D in serotonin and melatonin regulation, suggesting that increasing vitamin D status may be helpful for improving mood and sleep. This literature review covers the current state of evidence regarding potential effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep indicators in healthy people. In total, 11 observational studies were found for sleep, and 54 studies on mood (including ten RCTs). These studies revealed mixed results for both sleep and mood. The findings were interpreted based on the previously proposed serotonergic pathway of vitamin D. Implications and challenges for future research regarding the timing of blood sampling, timing and dosage of supplement intake and investigating the response dynamics are discussed. 

Smile aesthetics and malocclusion in UK teenage magazines assessed using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). 
OBJECTIVE: There is a significant demand for orthodontic treatment within the UK from adolescent girls, a group known to be influenced by the media portrayal of body form and body image, which may extend to the presentation of malocclusions. This study examined the portrayal of malocclusion in a media type that targets teenage girls under 16 years of age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative selection of 1 month's magazines targeting this group were investigated, and the frequency and severity of malocclusions displayed were assessed. Two calibrated examiners viewed all the smiles (on two occasions) using a modification of Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) and assigned an Aesthetic Component Score to each smile. RESULTS: It was found that the aesthetic score is low (less than 7) for the majority of models (92.8%) indicating no need or a borderline need for treatment. Only 7.2% of models exhibited a definite need for treatment. CONCLUSION: It appears that the portrayal of malocclusion in teenage magazines does not reflect the general treatment need of the adolescent population. 

The DONALD Study. History, current status and future perspectives. 
Nutrition during childhood and adolescence is an important determinant of development and health, both for the child and the later adult. In industrialised countries as well as in many countries of economic transition, emphasis has moved from combating nutrient deficiencies to research on the effects of overnutrition and food selection. Prevention of chronic diseases including obesity have become a major focus in research. However, the complex relation between infant growth and its related endocrine and metabolic changes on the one hand and the influence of nutrition and nutritional status on the other hand still need to be understood in detail. Studies aiming to elucidate this have to follow children and adolescents during their growth period. The following pages display the features of the German DONALD Study ( DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study) which was specifically designed to address these complex research questions. Finally, comparisons to other studies are made and the specific strength and weaknesses of this study are discussed. As the DONALD study offers unique research opportunities and due to its long follow-up an abundance of data, collaborative research is encouraged. 

Continuing education. 
A large, representative sample of licensed dental hygienists practicing in the United States was surveyed by ADHA regarding dental hygiene demographics, office characteristics, supervision and practice behavior, infection control practices, utilization of medical and dental histories, and continuing education. This paper presents the continuing education portion of this survey and specifically explores relationships among descriptive variables such as dental hygienists' ages, types of practice, membership in ADHA, continuing education courses attended, and interest versus need in continuing education course attendance. Results indicate that continuing education participation is most likely for dental hygienists under 25 years of age and who are working over 30 hours per week in a speciality office which employs seven or more staff members. Comparisons among dentist, dental hygienist, and dental assistant participation were made for selected continuing education topics. According to the respondents, more dental hygienists than dentists or dental assistants have participated in continuing education courses on blood pressure measurement, aseptic technique, AIDs, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Dental hygienists perceived a need for attendance by all dental personnel in selected continuing education programs. 

The FemCap: a new contraceptive choice. 
OBJECTIVE: To develop a female barrier to, first, prevent pregnancy and, second, protect against sexually transmitted diseases. DESIGN: The contraceptive is made of inert, soft material and is an anatomical design that utilizes the physiology of the vagina. It incorporates the use of microbicidal spermicide to kill sexually transmitted disease organisms. RESULTS: FemCap has been proven in clinical trials to be safe, and has no systemic or local side-effects, and does not increase the risk of urinary tract infections. Effectiveness in pregnancy prevention in 86.5% in typical use and 98% if used properly with emergency contraceptives as back-up. FemCap is highly acceptable to women and to their partners. CONCLUSIONS: A new method of birth control has arrived that is safe, effective, highly acceptable and may protect against sexually transmitted diseases of the upper female genital tract. 

Periodic movements during sleep, sleep fragmentation, and sleep-wake complaints. 
To better understand the relation of sleep complaint to sleep continuity and periodic movements during sleep (PMS), two groups of patients were studied retrospectively. One group of 51 patients, 26 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 56.4 years, complained of insomnia. The other group of 29 patients, 20 men and nine women, with a mean age of 55.8 years, complained of excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleepy patients differed significantly from insomnia patients in that they fell asleep faster and slept longer. They showed more frequent arousals (shifts to stage 1 sleep and number of awakenings) than insomnia patients who had longer arousals (mean duration of awakenings). Insomnia patients had more series of PMS, but sleepy patients had more PMS bursts per series. 

Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism: an epidemiological review. 
New epidemiological studies have demonstrated a higher risk of venous thromboembolism among users of oral contraceptives (OCs) with third-generation progestogens desogestrel or gestodene compared with users of OCs with second-generation progestogens levonorgestrel or norgestrel. As the absolute risk of venous thromboembolism among users of OCs in general is lower in the new studies than in previously published studies, and as several important potential confounders are not controlled for in the new studies, the real difference in risk of venous thromboembolism between users of third- compared with second-generation products may be smaller than indicated in these new studies. At the same time, the risk of myocardial infarction may be smaller among users of third- compared with users of second-generation products. Until further epidemiological data emerge, it is therefore difficult to make general recommendations other than to use OCs with a low estrogen dose, and to make individual recommendations based on age, individual wish, and individual risk factors. 

Beyond deficiency: potential benefits of increased intakes of vitamin K for bone and vascular health. 
Vitamin K is well known for its role in the synthesis of a number of blood coagulation factors. During recent years vitamin K-dependent proteins were discovered to be of vital importance for bone and vascular health. Recommendations for dietary vitamin K intake have been made on the basis of the hepatic requirements for the synthesis of blood coagulation factors. Accumulating evidence suggests that the requirements for other functions than blood coagulation may be higher. This paper is the result of a closed workshop (Paris, November 2002) in which a number of European vitamin K experts reviewed the available data and formulated their standpoint with respect to recommended dietary vitamin K intake and the use of vitamin K-containing supplements. 

The Associations Between Urbanicity and Physical Activity and Sitting Time in Mexico. 
BACKGROUND: Approximately 17.4% of people in Mexico self-report physical activity levels below the World Health Organization's guidelines and an average sedentary time of 16 hours per day.(1) Low physical activity has been associated with noncommunicable disease risk factors and previous research suggests that urbanicity might be an important determinant of physical activity. The aim of this study was to measure urbanicity in Mexico and assess if it is associated with physical activity and sitting time. METHODS: A sample of 2880 men and 4211 women aged 20 to 69 was taken from the 2012 Mexico National Health and Nutrition Survey and multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association between physical activity, sitting time and urbanicity; adjusting for sex, education level, socioeconomic status and Body Mass Index. The urbanicity score and the 7 urbanicity subscores were estimated from the CENSUS 2010. RESULTS: The subscores of demographic, economic activity, diversity and communication were negatively associated with physical activity. Sitting time was positively associated with the overall urbanicity, and the demographic and health subscores. CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of associations between urbanicity and physical activity in Mexico. 

Analysis of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in vegetable foods using high-performance liquid chromatography. 
Trans-resveratrol and resveratrol glucoside are natural phenolic compounds existed in a wide variety of plant species, which are extensively consumed in many countries. The existing studies excessively focused on grapes and their products, and little about daily vegetable foods. Actually, in much more countries, vegetable foods are residents' principal food and nutrient origins. This study was to investigate the levels of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in daily vegetable foods of China using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection (FLD). Trans-piceid was the major form existing in most vegetable foods, and most of the samples contained higher trans-piceid than trans-resveratrol. The contents of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in different varieties and regions were different. Moreover, peculiar vegetable foods to some region were also one of the most important sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid. Therefore, vegetable foods were other significant sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid except the foods published. 

The context and consequences of sexual assault among undergraduate women at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). 
To examine the context of sexual assault and postassault actions and consequences among women attending historically Black colleges or universities (HBCUs), web-based surveys were administered in November 2008 to 3,951 undergraduate women attending four HBCUs. Data on the context in which assaults occurred were generated for women who had been sexually assaulted since entering college (n = 358). Multivariate models were run on the full sample to examine the association between sexual assault and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results indicated that most survivors were assaulted by assailants well known to them and when the survivor and perpetrator were drinking alcohol. Very few survivors disclosed their experiences to formal sources of support. Survivors had significantly more symptoms of depression and were more likely to screen positive for PTSD than nonvictims. Further research on disclosure and its moderating role on the mental health consequences of sexual assault is needed. 

Representations of therapists by patients with personality disorders. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate attributes of mental representations of therapists by patients with specific personality disorders (PDs), schizotypal (STPD), borderline (BPD), avoidant (AVPD), and obsessive-compulsive (OCPD), and a comparison group with Major Depressive Disorder and no PD (MDD). The Therapist Representation Inventory-II (TRI) measured characteristics of participants' extra-session thoughts about their therapists. Results showed that patients with STPD had the highest level of mental involvement with therapy outside the session, missing their therapists and wishing for friendship, while also feeling aggressive or negative. Patients with BPD exhibited the most difficulty in creating a benign image of the therapist. Variables such as gender, co-occurring Axis I disorders, and amount of individual psychotherapy received were significant covariates for a number of analyses. The importance of understanding the internal dynamics of patients' thoughts about their treatment relationship was underscored. 

Postprandial Metabolic Effects of Accelerometer Measured Spontaneous Low-Level Activity. 
BACKGROUND: Interrupting sedentary time induces improvements in glucose metabolism; however, it is unclear how much activity is required to reduce the negative effects of prolonged sitting. METHODS: Sixty-six participants sat continuously for 9 hours except for required bathroom breaks. Participants were fed meal replacement beverages at 60, 240 and 420 min. Blood samples were obtained hourly for 9 hours, with additional samples collected 30 and 45 min after each feeding. Responses were calculated as incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride. Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer and a heart rate monitor. Energy expenditure was estimated using indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: After controlling for age, sex and BMI, every 100 count increase in accelerometer derived total movement was associated with a 0.06 mmol.L-1.9 hours decrease in glucose iAUC (95% CI 0.004-0.1; P = .035), but not associated with changes in insulin or triglyceride iAUC. Every 1 bpm increase in mean heart rate was associated with a 0.76 mmol.L-1.9 hours increase in triglyceride iAUC (95% CI 0.13-1.38). CONCLUSION: Accelerometer measured movement during periods of prolonged sitting can result in minor improvements in postprandial glucose metabolism, but not lipid metabolism. 

Phenolic composition, antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of Eryngium bornmuelleri leaf. 
Eryngium bornmuelleri Nab. (Tusi) is an endemic botanical from the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey traditionally used for preparation of herbal tea. Within this study, phenolic composition, antioxidant capacities and inhibitory activities towards selected digestive enzymes of E. bornmuelleri leaf were investigated. Sequential extracts, obtained by extraction of plant tissue by ethanol, acetone and water exhibited pronounced antioxidant capacities and in a dose-dependent manner suppressed the metabolic syndrome related enzymes: alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. All extracts contained high levels of phenolic compounds. Flavonoid glycosides were the main phytochemicals detected, with rutin as the major compound (70% of total phenolics). Chlorogenic, hydroxybenzoic and caftaric acids as well as traces of caffeic, ferulic and rosmarinic acids were also detected. Correlation analysis indicated that phenolic compounds were the major sources of the enzyme-inhibitory activities. This study suggests that E. bornmuelleri leaf extracts can modulate the metabolism of sugars and fats through inhibition of the relevant digestive enzymes. 

Can High-Intensity Interval Training Promote Skeletal Muscle Anabolism? 
Exercise training in combination with optimal nutritional support is an effective strategy to maintain or increase skeletal muscle mass. A single bout of resistance exercise undertaken with adequate protein availability increases rates of muscle protein synthesis and, when repeated over weeks and months, leads to increased muscle fiber size. While resistance-based training is considered the 'gold standard' for promoting muscle hypertrophy, other modes of exercise may be able to promote gains in muscle mass. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) comprises short bouts of exercise at or above the power output/speed that elicits individual maximal aerobic capacity, placing high tensile stress on skeletal muscle, and somewhat resembling the demands of resistance exercise. While HIIT induces rapid increases in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, the anabolic potential of HIIT for promoting concurrent gains in muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness has received less scientific inquiry. In this review, we discuss studies that have determined muscle growth responses after HIIT, with a focus on molecular responses, that provide a rationale for HIIT to be implemented among populations who are susceptible to muscle loss (e.g. middle-aged or older adults) and/or in clinical settings (e.g. pre- or post-surgery). 

Bullying Perpetration and Victimization: A Test of Traditional and Cyber-Behaviors as Latent Constructs. 
The current investigation hypothesized and tested latent bully/victim traits for physical, verbal, or relational bullying/victimization, both cyber and traditional behaviors. Data were collected from 1,356 German students who attended Grades 5 to 10: 48.4% males, 49.3% females from eight different schools in Northern Germany. Based on two samples for cross-validation (Ntraining set = 525, Nvalidation set = 525), study findings provided strong evidence of adequate model fit, both for traditional and cyber behaviors. Consistent with the current state of knowledge, bullying and victimization latent traits highly associated, more so for cyber behaviors than traditional ones. Thus, both the theoretical plausibility as well as statistical evidence support the application of latent modeling to these behaviors. Further research is needed to replicate the applied measurement models proposed in this work and to reveal moderators or measurement invariance across diverse populations. Nevertheless, the current evidence substantiates the importance of the application of a latent modeling approach to overcome known psychometric challenges of reliability and validity in bullying research. 

Occupational physical activity and the metabolic syndrome among working women: a Go Red North Dakota study. 
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) with occupational physical activity (OCPA) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among working women. METHODS: The prevalence of MetSyn was calculated for 642 working women. Self-report questionnaire was used to determine levels of OCPA and LTPA and other lifestyle factors. Biometric data were directly collected on all women. RESULTS: No direct relationship for OCPA and the MetSyn was determined. Sufficient LTPA however, was significantly associated with lower prevalence of MetSyn. No dose response relationship was determined with PA and MetSyn. The odds of having MetSyn was significantly higher for sedentary workers with insufficient LTPA compared with those achieving sufficient LTPA. The odds for MetSyn were similar among women employed in moderately active or heavy work yet completing insufficient LTPA compared with women doing sufficient LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: For women with sedentary occupations, a sufficient amount of LTPA is essential to reduce the risk of having the MetSyn. Women in moderate to heavy working occupations may be acquiring adequate amounts of PA to avoid having the MetSyn. 

Airborne transmission between room occupants during short-term events: Measurement and evaluation. 
This study experimentally examines and compares the dynamics and short-term events of airborne cross-infection in a full-scale room ventilated by stratum, mixing and displacement air distributions. Two breathing thermal manikins were employed to simulate a standing infected person and a standing exposed person. Four influential factors were examined, including separation distance between manikins, air change per hour, positioning of the two manikinsand air distribution. Tracer gas technique was used to simulate the exhaled droplet nuclei from the infected person and fast tracer gas concentration meters (FCM41) were used to monitor the concentrations. Real-time and average exposure indices were proposed to evaluate the dynamics of airborne exposure. The time-averaged exposure index depends on the duration of exposure time and can be considerably different during short-term events and under steady-state conditions. The exposure risk during short-term events may not always decrease with increasing separation distance. It changes over time and may not always increase with time. These findings imply that the control measures formulated on the basis of steady-state conditions are not necessarily appropriate for short-term events. 

Managing the uncertainties of low-level radioactive waste disposal. 
The disposal of low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) entails financial and safety risks not common to most market commodities. This manifests debilitating uncertainty regarding future waste volume and disposal technology performance in the market for waste disposal services. Dealing with the publicly perceived risks of LLRW disposal increases the total cost of the technology by an order of magnitude, relative to traditional shallow land burial. Therefore, this analysis first examines five proposed disposal facility designs and quantifies the costs associated with these two important sources of uncertainty. Based upon this analysis, a marketable disposal permit mechanism is proposed and analyzed for the purpose of reducing market uncertainty and thereby facilitating a market solution to the waste disposal problem. In addition to quantifying the costs, the results illustrate the ways in which the design of a technology is influenced by its institutional environment, and vice versa. 

Carotenoids and their metabolites are naturally occurring activators of gene expression via the pregnane X receptor. 
Carotenoids are important micronutrients in the human diet and are present in human serum at micromolar concentrations. In addition to their antioxidant potential, carotenoids obtain physiologically relevant properties such as influencing cellular signal pathways, gene expression or induction of detoxifying enzymes. In this study, we determined the transactivation of PXR by cotransfection with the full-length receptor and a PXR-responsive reporter gene. Carotenoids and retinol revealed a 5-6 fold reporter gene activity in HepG2 cells in comparison to a 7-fold induction by the well-known PXR agonist rifampicin, whereas apo-carotenals and lycopene exerted less or no activation potential. The inductive efficacy was hereby concentration-dependent. In addition, carotenoid- or retinol-mediated gene expression of PXR-responsive genes like CYP3A4/CYP3A7, CYP3A5, MDR-1 and MRP-2 has been determined in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR with up-regulative properties of beta-carotene or retinol being comparable to or even higher than that of rifampicin. In conclusion, PXR-mediated up-regulation of CYP3A4/CYP3A7 and CYP3A5 as well as MDR1 and MRP2 by carotenoids points to a potential interference on the metabolism of xenobiotic and endogenous relevant compounds. 

The relationship of child protection worker attitudes to attrition from the field. 
Child protection workers in 33 states and the District of Columbia participated in a survey conducted by the C. Henry Kempe National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine the attitudes and attributes of workers who terminate their careers in child protection. A year after the survey, telephone follow-up was done to identify respondents to the survey who had left the child protection field. Attributes and attitudes were then linked directly to whether workers had terminated or continued child protective service. Just 8.0% (15 of 187) of the workers had left the field. There were few differences between workers that departed and those whose services were retained. Both were generally dissatisfied with their profession at the time of the survey. The shrinking social service labor market and worker investment in the field are discussed as factors impeding turnover among child protection workers. 

Clinical symptomatology and treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. 
Patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) suffer from sensory and motor symptoms evoked in the limbs at rest. Symptoms increase in the evening and during the night. The circadian rhythm and the presence of involuntary periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) which are frequently associated with arousals probably cause the leading symptom of sleep disturbances in RLS. Patients who do not have typical RLS symptoms but whose polysomnography shows PLMS that either impact on sleep continuity or daytime functioning are diagnosed as having the periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). Dopaminergic agents such as levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) and dopamine agonists are considered the treatment of choice for RLS and PLMS. This article gives an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptomatology and diagnosis of RLS and PLMD and focuses on treatment strategies in both disorders. 

The influence of air travel on athletic performance. 
Rapid transmeridian flight is a common reality for modern athletes and it has often been assumed that air travel has detrimental effects on athletic performance. The plausibility of this assumption is supported by established deteriorations in sleep and mood following transmeridian flight. However, the scientific evidence supporting the assumption is neither consistent nor compelling. Studies that have assessed athletic performance following transmeridian flight have produced mixed results and are characterised by major methodological flaws. Recent retrospective assessments of athletic team performance based on distance travelled have generally failed to indicate performance impairments following transmeridian flight. The plausibility of transmeridian air travel impairing athletic performance would be indicated by demonstration of an internally-driven circadian rhythm of athletic performance, or of deleterious performance consequences following sleep deprivation or desynchronisation between the circadian system and the environment. More rigorous research is needed to establish whether athletic performance is influenced by air travel. 

Integrated testing strategy (ITS) for bioaccumulation assessment under REACH. 
REACH (registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals) regulation requires that all the chemicals produced or imported in Europe above 1 tonne/year are registered. To register a chemical, physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information needs to be reported in a dossier. REACH promotes the use of alternative methods to replace, refine and reduce the use of animal (eco)toxicity testing. Within the EU OSIRIS project, integrated testing strategies (ITSs) have been developed for the rational use of non-animal testing approaches in chemical hazard assessment. Here we present an ITS for evaluating the bioaccumulation potential of organic chemicals. The scheme includes the use of all available data (also the non-optimal ones), waiving schemes, analysis of physicochemical properties related to the end point and alternative methods (both in silico and in vitro). In vivo methods are used only as last resort. Using the ITS, in vivo testing could be waived for about 67% of the examined compounds, but bioaccumulation potential could be estimated on the basis of non-animal methods. The presented ITS is freely available through a web tool. 

Real limits in the virtual world: self-limiting behavior of Internet gamblers. 
The recent expansion of Internet gambling has stimulated debate, policy, and research on this relatively new phenomenon and its potential consequences. The current study focuses on bettors experiencing problems by sampling Internet gamblers who imposed limits on the amount they were allowed to deposit to a betting site. We analyzed the betting transactions over 18 months of all gamblers who subscribed to an online betting site in February, 2005 (N = 47,134), 567 of whom utilized the site's self-limit feature. Self-limiting gamblers played a wider variety of games and placed more bets than others prior to imposing limits. After imposing limits, self-limiters reduced their activity, but did not reduce the amount they wagered per bet. Time spent gambling, not just money spent, appears to be an important indicator of gambling problems. Self-limit programs appear to be promising options for Internet gamblers at-risk for gambling problems. 

A coupled airflow and source/sink model for simulating indoor VOC exposures. 
In this paper, a numerical model is presented to study the indoor air quality (IAQ) in a room with different emission sources, sinks, and ventilation methods. A computer program, ACCESS-IAQ, is developed to simulate the airflow pattern, the time history of the contaminant concentrations in the occupied zone, and the inhalation exposures. The program developed may be useful for IAQ professional to design healthy and comfortable indoor environments. A numerical study has been carried out to predict the effectiveness of a displacement ventilation and a mixing ventilation on volatile organic compound (VOC) removal in a model office. Results from the numerical predictions show that when a "wet" emission source (a freshly painted wood stain) is distributed uniformly across the floor area with sinks (gypsum board) from the four vertical walls, displacement ventilation has consistently lower exposure at the breathing level of the occupant in the room. Such an effect is mainly due to the higher ventilation efficiency of displacement ventilation compared to the mixing ventilation. The simulation results also show that the walls adsorb significant amounts of VOCs during the first hour and act as secondary sources thereafter. 

Practical issues and the assessment of pathological gamblers in a private practice setting. 
With increased awareness and knowledge of pathological gambling comes the opportunity to share various perspectives and emerging skills. Descriptions of the assessment and treatment of the pathological gambler, spouse, and family have mushroomed in the past twenty years. However, most treatment summaries have come out of institutional or government funded settings. This article discusses various practical aspects of working with pathological gamblers in an outpatient, fee for service private practice setting. The author also describes refinements made in the assessment process since he first began working with pathological gamblers in 1979. 

Evaluating negative process: a comparison of working alliance, interpersonal behavior, and narrative coherency among three psychotherapy outcome conditions. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships of three measures of the therapeutic relationship and their validity in predicting treatment outcome, including the early identification of two treatment-failure conditions. Forty-eight patient-therapist dyads, in 30-session therapies for personality-disordered patients, were classified as premature dropout (DO), poor outcome (PO), or good outcome (GO) cases. Poor and Good Outcomes were determined by a reliable change score. Dropout cases were terminated during the first third of treatment, and patients cited dissatisfaction with the therapy or therapist. Assessment of working alliance, interpersonal behavior and a new measure of narrative coherency in the first third of treatment revealed that DO dyads had significantly poorer alliances and less coherent narratives in early sessions, while PO dyads, who ultimately completed the 30-session treatment protocol, unexpectedly demonstrated the highest degree of hostile complementarity. Clinical implications of the results are discussed. 

Coding "We-ness" in couple's relationship stories: A method for assessing mutuality in couple therapy. 
OBJECTIVE: "We-ness," a couple's mutual investment in their relationship and in each other, has been found to be a potent dimension of couple resilience. This study examined the development of a method to capture We-ness in psychotherapy through the coding of relationship narratives co-constructed by couples ("We-Stories"). It used a coding system to identify the core thematic elements that make up these narratives. METHOD: Couples that self-identified as "happy" (N = 53) generated We-Stories and completed measures of relationship satisfaction and mutuality. These stories were then coded using the We-Stories coding manual. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that security, an element that involves aspects of safety, support, and commitment, was most common, appearing in 58.5% of all narratives. This element was followed by the elements of pleasure (49.1%) and shared meaning/vision (37.7%). The number of "We-ness" elements was also correlated with and predictive of discrepancy scores on measures of relationship mutuality, indicating the validity of the We-Stories coding manual. Limitations and future directions are discussed. 

The tobacco industry's use of Wall Street analysts in shaping policy. 
OBJECTIVE: To document how the tobacco industry has used Wall Street analysts to further its public policy objectives. METHODS: Searching tobacco documents available on the internet, newspaper articles, and transcripts of public hearings. RESULTS: The tobacco industry used nominally independent Wall Street analysts as third parties to support the tobacco industry's legislative agenda at both national and state levels in the USA. The tobacco industry has, for example, edited the testimony of at least one analyst before he testified to the US Senate Judiciary Committee, while representing himself as independent of the industry. CONCLUSION: The tobacco industry has used undisclosed collaboration with Wall Street analysts, as they have used undisclosed relationships with research scientists and academics, to advance the interests of the tobacco industry in public policy. 

Nicotine decreases attentional bias to negative-affect-related Stroop words among smokers. 
The present study examined the hypothesis that nicotine is associated with reduced attentional bias to affective and smoking-related stimuli in a modified Stroop task. A total of 56 habitual smokers were each tested on 4 days with 14 mg nicotine patches and placebo patches, counterbalanced, as a within-subjects factor in a double-blind design. A modified Stroop using negative-affect words, smoking words, color words, and neutral words was presented via computer in blocked format. As predicted, nicotine, relative to placebo, was associated with decreased attentional bias to negative words. Nicotine speeded performance during smoking-word and color-word blocks to the same degree as during neutral words and thus appeared to also have a nonspecific performance-enhancing effect. In an exploratory analysis, nicotine-attention effects occurred only in the initial presentation of pairs of blocked word pages. Nicotine also was associated with improved mood. The results are discussed in terms of affect-attention and smoking literatures. 

Optimization of a fermented soy product formulation with a kefir culture and fiber using a simplex-centroid mixture design. 
The objective of this work was to optimize a fermented soy product formulation with kefir and soy, oat and wheat fibers and to evaluate the fiber and product characteristics. A simplex-centroid mixture design was used for the optimization. Soymilk, soy, oat and wheat fiber mixtures, sucrose and anti-foaming agent were used for the formulation, followed by thermal treatment, cooling and the addition of flavoring. Fermentation was performed at 25 degreesC with a kefir culture until a pH of 4.5 was obtained. The products were cooled, homogenized and stored for analysis. From the mathematical models and variables response surface and desirability an optimal fermented product was formulated containing 3% (w/w) soy fiber. Compared with the other formulations, soy fermented product with 3% soy fiber had the best acidity, viscosity, syneresis, firmness and Lactococcus lactis count. 

Internet and everyday life: the perceived implications of internet use on memory and ability to concentrate. 
The growing role of Internet in all aspects of everyday life has led to speculations over the impacts beyond the traditional questions of access or sociability. This in mind, the main focus in this article was to examine how Finns, for majority of whom Internet use has become commonplace activity, perceive the impacts of Internet use since first adopting the technology. In this study, we examine how Internet user history and perceived computer skills, along with different sociodemographic factors, appear to reflect on the perceived impacts of Internet adoption in terms of memory and ability to concentrate. According to the results, almost one in five of the respondents reported changes concerning their memory or ability to concentrate, with skilled computer users and nonworkers, in particular, perceiving the change. Factors such as age-related differences and exposure to potential information overload at work were identified to explain the perceived change. Our data were collected in a survey-gathering information on the everyday life and well-being of Finns. The sample consisted of 2000 Finnish speakers aged 15 to 64 years. The response rate was 46 percent (N=908). 

Investigation of a ponding irrigation system to recycle agricultural wastewater. 
This article presents the results of natural carrying capacity of ponding irrigation system in Taoyuan agricultural zone, Taiwan. Both the systematic water quality and the ponding effects were examined. The ponding irrigation system included a flow channel and storage ponds. The data showed that most water characteristics deteriorated gradually from upper- to down-stream in the flow channel and the flow channel was not attributed to any self-purification in agricultural returning water practically. On the other hand, the results of storage ponds indicated that they can provide a natural treatment (i.e., the outlet water quality of the ponds is more desirable than that of the inlet). Consequently, the ponding irrigation system offers the natural self-purification in ponds to reuse and recycle the returning agricultural wastewater and to extend the irrigation capacity and efficiency. 

Health care providers' experiences with problem gamblers. 
The purpose of this study was to document health care providers' awareness of problem gambling and frequency of recognition and treatment. An exploratory survey was designed to collect data on awareness and knowledge of problem gambling. A structured questionnaire was completed anonymously by 180 health care providers (nurses, physicians, social workers, and other allied health professionals). Almost all respondents (96%) reported knowledge of problem gambling, and 30% reported asking clients about gambling problems when they presented with stress related symptoms. A third of the respondents reported identifying and treating clients for a gambling problem. The most frequently reported intervention was referral to counseling and other gambling resources. Respondents were generally interested in learning more about gambling problems, particularly those providers who have had a client discuss gambling related concerns. There were no significant differences in findings between provider groups. 

Associations between physical activity parenting practices and adolescent girls' self-perceptions and physical activity intentions. 
BACKGROUND: The current study investigated cross-sectional associations between maternal and paternal logistic and modeling physical activity support and the self-efficacy, self-esteem, and physical activity intentions of 11- to 12-year-old girls. METHODS: 210 girls reported perceptions of maternal and paternal logistic and modeling support and their self-efficacy, self-esteem and intention to be physically active. Data were analyzed using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Maternal logistic support was positively associated with participants' self-esteem, physical activity self-efficacy, and intention to be active. Maternal modeling was positively associated with self-efficacy. Paternal modeling was positively associated with self-esteem and self-efficacy but there was no evidence that paternal logistic support was associated with the psychosocial variables. CONCLUSIONS: Activity-related parenting practices were associated with psychosocial correlates of physical activity among adolescent girls. Logistic support from mothers, rather than modeling support or paternal support may be a particularly important target when designing interventions aimed at preventing the age-related decline in physical activity among girls. 

Segmentation in low-penetration and low-involvement categories: an application to lottery games. 
Market segmentation is accepted as a fundamental concept in marketing and several authors have recently proposed a segmentation model where personal and environmental variables intersect with each other to form motivating conditions that drive behavior and preferences. This model of segmentation has been applied to packaged goods. This paper extends this literature by proposing a segmentation model for low-penetration and low involvement (LP-LI) products. An application to the lottery games in Chile supports the proposed model. The results of the study show that in this type of products (LP-LI), the attitude towards the product category is the most important factor that distinguishes consumers from non consumers, and heavy users from light users, and consequently, a critical segmentation variable. In addition, a cluster analysis shows the existence of three segments: (1) the impulsive dreamers, who believe in chance, and in that lottery games can change their life, (2) the skeptical, that do not believe in chance, nor in that lottery games can change their life and (3) the willing, who value the benefits of playing. 

Abnormal visual P300 latency in obstructive sleep apnea does not change acutely upon treatment with CPAP. 
This study evaluated the effects of 2-4 months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on previously demonstrated P300 latency prolongations in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects with severe OSA (respiratory disturbance index > 40/hour sleep) were administered polysomnograms, auditory and visual P300 testing using 31 scalp electrodes, and multiple sleep latency testing before and after treatment with CPAP for 2-4 months. Despite significant improvements in sleep and respiratory variables and the mean sleep latency, there were no significant P300 changes. Obstructive sleep apnea patients had prolonged visual P300 latency compared to normals, both before and after treatment. Prolongations in P300 latency that are resistant to the acute effects of CPAP may suggest that OSA causes physiological cortical changes that are unrelated to sleepiness and may be resistant to treatment. 

Research on electroencephalogram to measure thermal pleasure in thermal alliesthesia in temperature step-change environment. 
Thermal pleasure is currently measured along psychological and physiological variables. However, in transient environments where temperatures change, it is hard to correlate psychological and physiological measures, because there is a delay in physiological changes. This study tests a method for correlating both measures using electroencephalogram (EEG), which can capture physiological feedback with a rapid response rate. In this experimental study, thermal pleasure was induced in a temperature step-change environment, one of non-uniform and transient environments. During the experiment, EEG was monitored and psychological responses of thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes were collected via survey questionnaire. A total of 50 males in their twenties participated in a climate chamber experiment. An experimental group of 25 men were exposed to temperature step-change between two different room conditions (32degreesC, 65% and 25degreesC, 50%), experiencing thermal pleasure. The control group of the remaining 25 men were exposed to an unchanging condition, experiencing thermal comfort close to thermal neutrality. The EEG spectral analysis demonstrated that EEG frequency band associated with pleasant emotional (theta) increased while frequency band related to pleasantness, satisfaction or relaxation (beta) decreased with thermal pleasure. 

Investigating electronic word-of-mouth effects on online discussion forums: the role of perceived positive electronic word-of-mouth review credibility. 
Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has been an important factor influencing consumer purchase decisions. Using the ABC model of attitude, this study proposes a model to explain how eWOM affects online discussion forums. Specifically, we propose that platform (Web site reputation and source credibility) and customer (obtaining buying-related information and social orientation through information) factors influence purchase intentions via perceived positive eWOM review credibility, as well as product and Web site attitudes in an online community context. A total of 353 online discussion forum users in an online community (Fashion Guide) in Taiwan were recruited, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The results indicate that Web site reputation, source credibility, obtaining buying-related information, and social orientation through information positively influence perceived positive eWOM review credibility. In turn, perceived positive eWOM review credibility directly influences purchase intentions and also indirectly influences purchase intentions via product and Web site attitudes. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings. 

Attentional bias in addictive behaviors: a review of its development, causes, and consequences. 
A wealth of research from the past two decades shows that addictive behaviors are characterized by attentional biases for substance-related stimuli. We review the relevant evidence and present an integration of existing theoretical models to explain the development, causes, and consequences of addiction-related attentional biases. We suggest that through classical conditioning, substance-related stimuli elicit the expectancy of substance availability, and this expectancy causes both attentional bias for substance-related stimuli and subjective craving. Furthermore, attentional bias and craving have a mutual excitatory relationship such that increases in one lead to increases in the other, a process that is likely to result in substance self-administration. Cognitive avoidance strategies, impulsivity, and impaired inhibitory control appear to influence the strength of attentional biases and subjective craving. However, some measures of attentional bias, particularly the addiction Stroop, might reflect multiple underlying processes, so results need to be interpreted cautiously. We make several predictions that require testing in future research, and we discuss implications for the treatment of addictive behaviors. 

Genetic factors in human sleep disorders with special reference to Norrie disease, Prader-Willi syndrome and Moebius syndrome. 
Sleep-wake problems are common in specific inborn errors of metabolism and structure of the central nervous system. Psychological factors, behavioural difficulties, metabolic disturbances, and widespread rather than focal damage to the nervous system are present in many of these diseases and all influence the sleep-wake cycle. However, a number of conditions cause relatively focal damage to the neuroanatomical substrate of sleeping and waking. These include fatal familial insomnia, with involvement of the prion protein gene on chromosome 20, Norrie disease, the Prader-Willi syndrome and the Moebius syndrome. The last three important conditions, although rare, are considered in detail in this review. They result in sensory deprivation, hypothalamic and mid-brain damage, and involve the X-chromosome, chromosome 15, and chromosome 13, respectively. These conditions cause a wide variety of sleep disturbance, including parasomnias, daytime sleepiness, and a condition like cataplexy. The place of the relevant gene products in normal sleep regulation needs further exploration. 

In vivo effectiveness of enamel sealants around orthodontic brackets. 
OBJECTIVE: In this randomized study, the caries-protective effect on vestibular enamel of two fluoride-containing sealants (Protecto(R) and Light Bond(R)) during multibracket treatment was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 40 orthodontic patients about to receive a multibracket appliance with the brackets bonded to the vestibular tooth surfaces were randomly included in this study. Each one was randomly assigned to one of four groups. A crossover design was selected in which a sealed quadrant was contralateral to an unsealed quadrant, then choosing the reverse configuration in the opposite jaw. Two sealants were, thus, tested on vestibular enamel on left and right anterior teeth and premolars in both jaws of each patient over 6 months of multibracket treatment. A DIAGNOdent(R) pen measuring laser fluorescence was used to analyze the relevant enamel surfaces both at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Neither the incidence nor the characteristics of the demineralization we observed during the study differed between the 4 groups. CONCLUSION: Single application of smooth-surface sealants did not protect enamel around brackets from incipient carious lesions during the first 6 months of multibracket treatment. 

"I'm not the only one!" group therapy with older children and adolescents who have learning disabilities. 
Children and adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) are vulnerable to psychosocial difficulties. Both the detrimental impact of LD on social adjustment and the significance of peer relations for developmental needs make group therapy a natural intervention. Despite modifications that are required due to their cognitive deficits, many students with LD fit the criteria and can benefit from group psychotherapy. In this paper, a model of group therapy for older children and adolescents with LD is presented. The approach is informed by a combination of self psychology, mutual aid, and interpersonal group therapy. The leaders use special techniques to accommodate the LD and to foster the group process. Examples are presented to illustrate the approach. 

Classification of maltreatment-related mortality by Child Death Review teams: How reliable are they? 
Accurate estimation of the incidence of maltreatment-related child mortality depends on reliable child fatality review. We examined the inter-rater reliability of maltreatment designation for two Alaskan Child Death Review (CDR) panels. Two different multidisciplinary CDR panels each reviewed a series of 101 infant and child deaths (ages 0-4 years) in Alaska. Both panels independently reviewed identical medical, autopsy, law enforcement, child welfare, and administrative records for each death utilizing the same maltreatment criteria. Percent agreement for maltreatment was 64.7% with a weighted Kappa of 0.61 (95% CI 0.51, 0.70). Across maltreatment subtypes, agreement was highest for abuse (69.3%) and lowest for negligence (60.4%). Discordance was higher if the mother was unmarried or a smoker, if residence was rural, or if there was a family history of child protective services report(s). Incidence estimates did not depend on which panel's data were used. There is substantial room for improvement in the reliability of CDR panel assessment of maltreatment related mortality. Standardized decision guidance for CDR panels may improve the reliability of their data. 

The experience of group mindfulness-based interventions for individuals with mental health difficulties: a meta-synthesis. 
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to synthesize the findings of qualitative studies examining the experience of individuals with mental health difficulties attending mindfulness-based interventions. METHOD: A meta-synthesis of 15 qualitative studies was carried out, using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: The meta-synthesis identified eight analytical themes: 'prior experiences and expectations', 'normalising and supportive process of the group', 'relating differently to thoughts and feelings', 'acceptance', 'a sense of control and choice', 'relationship with self and others', 'struggles', and 'awareness'. CONCLUSIONS: A conceptual framework is presented which accounts for the participants' experiences and suggests a process through which they renegotiate their relationship with their mental health difficulties. 

A randomized controlled trial to investigate brackets bonded with a hydrophilic primer. 
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical failure rates of brackets bonded using a prototype hydrophilic primer, designed to be insensitive to moisture, with brackets bonded with a conventional primer. DESIGN: Single centre randomised controlled clinical study. Thirty-three patients were bonded using a split mouth technique: randomly allocating the hydrophilic primer to one side of the mouth and a conventional primer to the other. SETTING: Hospital orthodontic department, Bradford, UK. SUBJECTS: Orthodontic patients requiring fixed appliances. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The site and time to bond failure was recorded for each bracket that failed over 6 months. RESULTS: Using survival analysis, there was an increased risk of bracket failure when bonded with the hydrophilic primer compared with the conventional primer (hazard ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 4.5, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This hydrophilic primer cannot be recommended for routine clinical use. 

Proximity to School and Physical Activity Among Middle School Girls: The Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls Study. 
BACKGROUND: Proximity to routine destinations is an important correlate of physical activity. We examined the association between distance from school and physical activity in adolescent girls. METHODS: We mapped the addresses of 1554 sixth-grade girls who participated in the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) Study and calculated the shortest distance from home to school along the street network. Using a hierarchical design we examined the association between MET-weighted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MW- MVPA) and distance to school, while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Distance to school was inversely associated with weekday MW- MVPA for middle school girls. For every mile the girls lived from their schools, they engaged in an average of 13 fewer MET-weighted minutes per week. CONCLUSIONS: Distance to school is inversely associated with MW-MVPA. The most adversely affected girls lived more than 5 miles from school. Time spent commuting could explain reduced time for physical activity.
