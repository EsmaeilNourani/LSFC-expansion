Metaphor and psychotherapy. 
The authors describe the role of metaphor in the theory and practice of psychotherapy. Metaphors are considered fundamental elements of our worlds of language and concepts and not just figures of speech, poetic devices, parables, or creative ways to make interpretations. Metaphors shape the process of therapy by structuring the therapist's perceptions, stance, and attitude. They also organize the way problems are discussed as well as the solution that are seen as effective. The authors review the literature on metaphor in psychotherapy and explore common psychotherapeutic metaphors such as "psychotherapy is war," "the mind is a brittle object," "the conduit metaphor," and a variety of somatic metaphors. They conclude with a discussion of how metaphors function in the process of psychotherapy.
