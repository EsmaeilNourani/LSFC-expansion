Determination of observer-rated alpha activity during sleep. 
Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been described as having alpha intrusion into sleep. In a separate study of the relationship between depression and CFS, we investigated the sleep of CFS patients. We could not detect any observable alpha anomaly in our group of CFS patients. It is possible that there is a subgroup of CFS patients in whom no alpha anomaly is present. However, the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) montage used in our study was different to that employed by previous researchers. This paper investigates the influence of electrode derivations on the outcome of observable alpha ratings. We compared simultaneous recordings of sleep EEG using three commonly employed montages. Our results indicate that use of the mastoid reference (montage 1) results in the highest observer-related alpha. This may suggest that data regarding alpha intrusion should always be collected using montage 1. However, there is a possibility that the mastoid electrode is not electrically silent and is contaminating the data of the referenced channels. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the validity of alpha intrusion measurement of CFS and fibromyalgia.
