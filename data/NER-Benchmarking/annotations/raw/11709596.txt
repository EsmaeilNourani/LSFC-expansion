A randomized controlled trial to investigate brackets bonded with a hydrophilic primer. 
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical failure rates of brackets bonded using a prototype hydrophilic primer, designed to be insensitive to moisture, with brackets bonded with a conventional primer. DESIGN: Single centre randomised controlled clinical study. Thirty-three patients were bonded using a split mouth technique: randomly allocating the hydrophilic primer to one side of the mouth and a conventional primer to the other. SETTING: Hospital orthodontic department, Bradford, UK. SUBJECTS: Orthodontic patients requiring fixed appliances. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The site and time to bond failure was recorded for each bracket that failed over 6 months. RESULTS: Using survival analysis, there was an increased risk of bracket failure when bonded with the hydrophilic primer compared with the conventional primer (hazard ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 4.5, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This hydrophilic primer cannot be recommended for routine clinical use.
