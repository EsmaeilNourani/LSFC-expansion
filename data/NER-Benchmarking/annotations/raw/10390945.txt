Aliveness in the work of the group: a subjective guide to creative character change. 
The subjective response of aliveness in the work of the group may be a valuable signal on the journey toward creative character change in group therapy. In order to promote change in others, the group therapist must engage deeply and use internal responses as guides during interactions with group members as well as in relation to the group as a whole. Subjective awareness of increased aliveness that is linked with a sense of the work of the group may guide both therapist and group participants in the midst of inevitable anxieties and passions aroused during this quest for new vitality and freedom in relationships in the group. Winnicott's concept of potential space as well as group-relations theory about the primary task provide a conceptual foundation for this approach not only on the level of the individual member within the group but also on the level of the group as a whole.
