Atmospheric nitrogen compounds-issues related to agricultural systems. 
Workable pollution abatement policies and effective legislation must be based on sound science. However, despite many years of research, there are still uncertainties about the effects of atmospheric nitrogen compounds on crops and other vegetation. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the main compounds, focussing on the concentrations and combinations of pollutants that occur in rural areas. The sources, concentrations and effects of oxidised, reduced and organic nitrogen compounds are considered in turn, then the effects of deposited nitrogen on ecosystems are discussed. Research priorities on the effects of deposited nitrogen in Europe and the USA are compared. Finally, the review leads to a list of issues for discussion and recommendations for research.
