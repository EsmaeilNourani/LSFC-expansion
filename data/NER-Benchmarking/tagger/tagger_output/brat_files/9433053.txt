Interdisciplinary concepts in treating adult patients. 
Pre-prosthetics, as a part of orthodontic treatment in adults has gained increasing importance during recent years. Through coordinated orthodontic, prosthetic and periodontal treatment plans, patients with partial dentition can be offered further treatment possibilities. Such planning would allow for fixed prosthetic treatment possibilities and the survival of critical teeth. They would provide for better aesthetics and avoid functional disturbances. The aim of the present study was to present reports of patients treated by coordinated work at the Dental School of Hamburg University. In patients with partial dentition, premolars were uprighted and distally moved and molars were extruded to be used as abutments for fixed prosthetic reconstructions. Following trauma, the position of the remaining anterior teeth was improved to provide for optimal aesthetics after prosthetic treatment. Extraction of a subalveolarly fractured tooth is avoided through root extrusion and post-core reconstruction. The results demonstrate the advantages of pre-prosthetic treatment as regards stability, aesthetics and function. With the help of pre-prosthetic orthodontic treatment, complicated treatment situations could be handled more successfully than would have been the case without such treatment.
