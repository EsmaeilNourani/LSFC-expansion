Sexual function changes attributed to hormonal contraception use - a qualitative study of women experiencing negative effects. 
Objective: To increase the understanding of women who experience negative effects on sexual function when using hormonal contraception.Methods: We performed 24 in-depth interviews with women who had previously experienced negative sexual function effects while using hormonal contraceptives. The thematic analysis method was used.Results: 'After experience comes insight', 'Lubrication and desire go hand in hand', 'Mental wellbeing comes before desire' and 'The contraceptive counsellor potentially facilitates insight and decision-making' were the main themes found in the study.Conclusions: This selected group of women described lubrication difficulties and decreased sexual desire associated with both contraceptive use and the menstrual cycle. Contraceptive use became easier with age and with better understanding. The contraceptive counsellor could facilitate the process. Further choice between hormonal or non-hormonal contraceptive methods depended primarily on experienced adverse effects on mood, and secondarily on sexual function, weighed against the advantages or disadvantages experienced during the person's own menstrual cycle.
