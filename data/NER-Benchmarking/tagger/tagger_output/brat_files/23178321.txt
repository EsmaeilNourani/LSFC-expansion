Development and initial validation of the White Bear Suppression Inventory (Smoking Version). 
INTRODUCTION: Thought suppression can produce a paradoxical rebound in unwanted cognition. Although interest in the role of suppression in nicotine dependence is growing quickly, a validated measure specifically assessing suppression of smoking-related thoughts does not exist. The present study describes the development of the White Bear Suppression Inventory-Smoking Version (WBSI-S). METHOD: The WBSI-S, in vivo monitoring of avoidance, and several other measures were completed as a part of a larger study on smoking cessation. Participants (N = 172) completed measures either during (n = 83) or preceding a smoking cessation attempt. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure for the WBSI-S, which was consistent across experimental groups. Both the Intrusive Smoking-related Thoughts and Thought Suppression subscales showed strong internal consistency. The Suppression subscale showed good convergent and discriminant validity; the Intrusion subscale demonstrated equivocal discrimination from other constructs. Participants completing the measure during a quit attempt reported higher self-reported suppression of thoughts about smoking than did continuing smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results support the construct validity of the suppression subscale and emphasize the importance of assessing suppression independently from intrusion.
