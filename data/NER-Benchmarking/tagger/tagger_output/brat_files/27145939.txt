Alternate rapid maxillary expansion-constriction and tooth-borne symphyseal distraction osteogenesis : A case report demonstrating treatment of a patient with severe crowding. 
Surgically assisted rapid mandibular expansion is a contemporary treatment alternative to enable genuine skeletal mandibular widening. Mandibular widening via a tooth-borne distractor is a practical and noninvasive clinical approach. Recently, to expand and protract the maxilla, the alternate rapid maxillary expansion-and-constriction procedure was suggested. In this case report, we describe a female patient (12 years 7 months old) having severe maxillary and mandibular crowding who underwent repeated alternate rapid maxillary expansion and constriction in combination with tooth-borne symphyseal distraction osteogenesis.
