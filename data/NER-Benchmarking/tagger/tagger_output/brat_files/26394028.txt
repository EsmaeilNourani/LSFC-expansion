Analysis of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in vegetable foods using high-performance liquid chromatography. 
Trans-resveratrol and resveratrol glucoside are natural phenolic compounds existed in a wide variety of plant species, which are extensively consumed in many countries. The existing studies excessively focused on grapes and their products, and little about daily vegetable foods. Actually, in much more countries, vegetable foods are residents' principal food and nutrient origins. This study was to investigate the levels of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in daily vegetable foods of China using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection (FLD). Trans-piceid was the major form existing in most vegetable foods, and most of the samples contained higher trans-piceid than trans-resveratrol. The contents of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid in different varieties and regions were different. Moreover, peculiar vegetable foods to some region were also one of the most important sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid. Therefore, vegetable foods were other significant sources of trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid except the foods published.
