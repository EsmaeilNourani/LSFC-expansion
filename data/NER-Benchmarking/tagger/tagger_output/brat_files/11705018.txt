Health care providers' experiences with problem gamblers. 
The purpose of this study was to document health care providers' awareness of problem gambling and frequency of recognition and treatment. An exploratory survey was designed to collect data on awareness and knowledge of problem gambling. A structured questionnaire was completed anonymously by 180 health care providers (nurses, physicians, social workers, and other allied health professionals). Almost all respondents (96%) reported knowledge of problem gambling, and 30% reported asking clients about gambling problems when they presented with stress related symptoms. A third of the respondents reported identifying and treating clients for a gambling problem. The most frequently reported intervention was referral to counseling and other gambling resources. Respondents were generally interested in learning more about gambling problems, particularly those providers who have had a client discuss gambling related concerns. There were no significant differences in findings between provider groups.
