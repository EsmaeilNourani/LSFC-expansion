caffeine	LFID:0000175	MESH	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D002110	A methylxanthine naturally occurring in some beverages and also used as a pharmacological agent. Caffeine's most notable pharmacological effect is as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing alertness and producing agitation. It also relaxes SMOOTH MUSCLE, stimulates CARDIAC MUSCLE, stimulates DIURESIS, and appears to be useful in the treatment of some types of headache. Several cellular actions of caffeine have been observed, but it is not entirely clear how each contributes to its pharmacological profile. Among the most important are inhibition of cyclic nucleotide PHOSPHODIESTERASES, antagonism of ADENOSINE RECEPTORS, and modulation of intracellular calcium handling.
caffeine	LFID:0000175	MEDLINEPLUS	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MEDLINEPLUS/C0006644	"<h3>What is caffeine?</h3> <p>Caffeine is a bitter substance that occurs naturally in more than 60 plants including:</p><ul> <li>Coffee beans</li> <li>Tea leaves</li> <li>Kola nuts, which are used to flavor soft drink colas</li> <li>Cacao pods, which are used to make chocolate products</li> </ul> <p>There is also synthetic (man-made) caffeine, which is added to some medicines, foods, and drinks. For example, some pain relievers, cold medicines, and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and ""energy-boosting"" gums and snacks.</p> <p>Most people consume caffeine from drinks. The amount of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot, but it is generally:</p><ul> <li>An 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mg</li> <li>A 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mg</li> <li>An 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mg</li> <li>An 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mg</li> </ul> <h3>What are caffeine's effects on the body?</h3> <p>Caffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism. It:</p><ul> <li>Stimulates your central nervous system, which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energy</li> <li>Is a diuretic, meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating more</li> <li>Increases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/heartburn.html"">heartburn</a></li> <li>May interfere with the absorption of calcium in the body</li> <li>Increases your blood pressure</li> </ul> <p>Within one hour of eating or drinking caffeine, it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours.</p> <h3>What are the side effects from too much caffeine?</h3> <p>For most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as:</p><ul> <li>Restlessness and shakiness</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/insomnia.html"">Insomnia</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/headache.html"">Headaches</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dizzinessandvertigo.html"">Dizziness</a></li> <li>Fast heart rate</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html"">Dehydration</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html"">Anxiety</a></li> <li>Dependency, so you need to take more of it to get the same results</li> </ul> <p>Some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.</p> <h3>What are energy drinks, and why can they be a problem?</h3> <p>Energy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.</p> <p>Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes.</p> <p>Sometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more.

caffeine	LFID:0000175	PDQ	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PDQ/CDR0000040817	"A naturally occurring xanthine derivative with central nervous system (CNS) stimulating activity. Due to the structural similarity to adenosine, caffeine binds to and blocks adenosine receptors, thereby preventing the inhibitory effects of adenosine on nerve cells. This leads to stimulation of medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers in the brain; and the release of epinephrine. Physiologic responses can include bradycardia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, CNS excitablility, increased respiratory rate, increased blood pressure, increased blood flow to muscles, decreased blood flow to skin and inner organs, and release of glucose by the liver. Due to the interaction between adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptors, caffeine can also indirectly increase the levels of dopamine in the brain.

Upon ingestion, caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which inhibits adenosine binding. This inhibits the adenosine-mediated downregulation of CNS activity; thus, stimulating the activity of the medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers in the brain. This agent also promotes neurotransmitter release that further stimulates the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of caffeine are due the nonselective competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Inhibition of PDEs raises the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates protein kinase A, and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, which leads to reduced inflammation and innate immunity.

Symptoms of an overdose include <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html"">anxiety</a>, panic, and a rapid heartbeat. In rare cases, an overdose can cause paranoia and hallucinations. There are no reports of people dying from using just marijuana.</p> <h3>Is marijuana addictive?</h3> <p>After using marijuana for a while, it is possible to get addicted to it. You are more likely to become addicted if you use marijuana every day or you started using it when you were a teenager. If you are addicted, you will have a strong need to take the drug. You may also need to smoke more and more of it to get the same high. When you try to quit, you may have mild withdrawal symptoms such as:</p><ul> <li>Irritability</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/insomnia.html"">Trouble sleeping</a></li> <li>Decreased appetite</li> <li>Anxiety</li> <li>Cravings</li> </ul> <h3>What is medical marijuana?</h3> <p>The marijuana plant has chemicals that can help with some health problems. More states are making it legal to use the plant as medicine for certain medical conditions. But there isn't enough research to show that the whole plant works to treat or cure these conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine. Marijuana is still illegal at the national level.</p> <p>However, there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids, the chemicals in marijuana. The two main cannabinoids that are of medical interest are THC and CBD. The FDA has approved two drugs that contain THC. These drugs treat nausea caused by <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html"">chemotherapy</a> and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html"">AIDS</a>.

It can be mixed with water and injected with a needle. Heroin can also be smoked or snorted up the nose. All of these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly. This makes it very addictive.</p> <p>Major health problems from heroin include miscarriages, heart infections, and death from overdose.

This includes <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html"">heart disease</a> and lung cancer.

Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes.</p> <p><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/ecigarettes.html"">E-cigarettes</a> often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Not much is known about the health risks of using them. We do know they contain nicotine, the same addictive substance in tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals.</p> <p><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/smokelesstobacco.html"">Smokeless tobacco</a>, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/gumdisease.html"">gum disease</a>, and oral lesions.</p> <h3>Why should I quit?</h3> <p>Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html"">Quitting smoking</a> can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include:</p><ul> <li>Lower heart rate and blood pressure</li> <li>Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen)</li> <li>Better circulation</li> <li>Less coughing and wheezing</li> </ul> <p class="""">NIH National Cancer Institute</p>"

It travels in the form of energy waves or high-speed particles. Radiation can occur naturally or be man-made. There are two types:</p><ul> <li><strong>Non-ionizing radiation,</strong> which includes radio waves, cell phones, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light</li> <li><strong>Ionizing radiation,</strong> which includes ultraviolet radiation, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/radon.html"">radon</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html"">x-rays</a>, and gamma rays</li> </ul> <h3>What are the sources of radiation exposure?</h3> <p>Background radiation is all around us all the time. Most of it forms naturally from minerals. These radioactive minerals are in the ground, soil, water, and even our bodies. Background radiation can also come from outer space and the sun. Other sources are man-made, such as x-rays, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html"">radiation therapy</a> to treat cancer, and electrical power lines.</p> <h3>What are the health effects of radiation exposure?</h3> <p>Radiation has been around us throughout our evolution. So our bodies are designed to deal with the low levels we're exposed to every day. But too much radiation can damage tissues by changing cell structure and damaging DNA. This can cause serious health problems, including cancer.</p> <p>The amount of damage that exposure to radiation can cause depends on several factors, including:</p><ul> <li>The type of radiation</li> <li>The dose (amount) of radiation</li> <li>How you were exposed, such as through skin contact, swallowing or breathing it in, or having rays pass through your body</li> <li>Where the radiation concentrates in the body and how long it stays there</li> <li>How sensitive your body is to radiation. A fetus is most vulnerable to the effects of radiation. Infants, children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable to health effects than healthy adults.</li> </ul> <p>Being exposed to a lot of radiation over a short period of time, such as from a <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/radiationemergencies.html"">radiation emergency</a>, can cause skin <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/burns.html"">burns</a>. It may also lead to acute radiation syndrome (ARS, or ""radiation sickness""). The symptoms of ARS include headache and diarrhea. They usually start within hours. Those symptoms will go away and the person will seem healthy for a little while. But then they will get sick again. How soon they get sick again, which symptoms they have, and how sick they get depends on the amount of radiation they received. In some cases, ARS causes death in the following days or weeks.</p> <p>Exposure to low levels of radiation in the environment does not cause immediate health effects. But it can slightly increase your overall risk of cancer.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for acute radiation sickness?</h3> <p>Before they start treatment, health care professionals need to figure out how much radiation your body absorbed. They will ask about your symptoms, do blood tests, and may use a device that measures radiation. They also try get more information about the exposure, such as what type of radiation it was, how far away you were from the source of the radiation, and how long you were exposed.</p> <p>Treatment focuses on reducing and treating infections, preventing <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html"">dehydration</a>, and treating injuries and burns. Some people may need treatments that help the <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowdiseases.html"">bone marrow</a> recover its function. If you were exposed to certain types of radiation, your provider may give you a treatment that limits or removes the contamination that is inside your body. You may also get treatments for your symptoms.</p> <h3>How can radiation exposure be prevented?</h3> <p>There are steps you can take to prevent or reduce radiation exposure:</p><ul> <li>If your health care provider recommends a test that uses radiation, ask about its risks and benefits. In some cases, you may be able to have a different test that does not use radiation. But if you do need a test that uses radiation, do some research into the local imaging facilities. Find one that monitors and uses techniques to reduce the doses they are giving patients.</li> <li>Reduce <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/electromagneticfields.html"">electromagnetic radiation</a> exposure from your cell phone. At this time, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. More research is needed to be sure. But if you still have concerns, you can reduce how much time you spend on your phone. You can also use speaker mode or a headset to place more distance between your head and the cell phone.</li> <li>If you live in a house, test the radon levels, and if you need to, get a radon reduction system.</li> <li>During a radiation emergency, get inside a building to take shelter. Stay inside, with all of the windows and doors shut. Stay tuned to and follow the advice of emergency responders and officials.</li> </ul> <p class="""">Environmental Protection Agency</p>"

Lead can be found in all parts of our environment. Much of it comes from human activities such as mining and manufacturing. Lead used to be in paint; older houses may still have lead paint. You could be exposed to lead by:</p><ul> <li>Eating food or drinking water that contains lead. Water pipes in older homes may contain lead.</li> <li>Working in a job where lead is used</li> <li>Using lead in a hobby, such as making stained glass or lead-glazed pottery</li> <li>Using folk remedies such as herbs or foods that contain lead</li> </ul> <p>Breathing air, drinking water, eating food, or swallowing or touching dirt that contains lead can cause many health problems. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. In adults, lead can increase blood pressure and cause infertility, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain. It can also make you irritable and affect your ability to concentrate and remember.</p> <p>Lead is especially dangerous for children. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop anemia, severe stomachache, muscle weakness, and brain damage. Even at low levels, lead can affect a child's mental and physical growth.</p> <p class="""">Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry</p>"

carbs	LFID:0000518	MEDLINEPLUS	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MEDLINEPLUS/C0007004	"<h3>What are carbohydrates?</h3> <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryproteins.html"">proteins</a> and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfats.html"">fats</a>, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.</p> <p>Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bloodsugar.html"">blood sugar</a>, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use.</p> <h3>What are the different types of carbohydrates?</h3> <p>There are three main types of carbohydrates:</p><ul> <li><strong>Sugars.</strong> They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk.</li> <li><strong>Starches.</strong> They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn.</li> <li><strong><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfiber.html"">Fiber</a>.</strong> It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/constipation.html"">constipation</a>. They may also help lower <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html"">cholesterol</a> and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.</li> </ul> <h3>Which foods have carbohydrates?</h3> <p>Common foods with carbohydrates include:</p><ul> <li>Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice</li> <li>Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges</li> <li>Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt</li> <li>Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas</li> <li>Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts</li> <li>Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar</li> <li>Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas</li> </ul> <p>Some foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils.</p> <h3>Which types of carbohydrates should I eat?</h3> <p>You do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health:</p><ul> <li>When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains: <ul> <li>Whole grains are foods like whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/vitamins.html"">vitamins</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/minerals.html"">minerals</a>, and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed.</li> <li>Refined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Eat foods with lots of fiber. The <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/foodlabeling.html"">Nutrition Facts labels</a> on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has.</li> <li>Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink.</li> </ul> <h3>How many carbohydrates should I eat?</h3> <p>There is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health.</p> <h3>Is it safe to eat a low-carb diet?</h3> <p>Some people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day. They can also be hard to stay on for the long term.</p>"

vitamin B6	LFID:0000610	MESH	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D025101	VITAMIN B 6 refers to several PICOLINES (especially PYRIDOXINE; PYRIDOXAL; & PYRIDOXAMINE) that are efficiently converted by the body to PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE which is a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. During transamination of amino acids, pyridoxal phosphate is transiently converted into PYRIDOXAMINE phosphate. Although pyridoxine and Vitamin B 6 are still frequently used as synonyms, especially by medical researchers, this practice is erroneous and sometimes misleading (EE Snell; Ann NY Acad Sci, vol 585 pg 1, 1990). Most of vitamin B6 is eventually degraded to PYRIDOXIC ACID and excreted in the urine.

Niacin is converted to its active form niacinamide, which is a component of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphate form, NADP. These coenzymes play an important role in tissue respiration and in glycogen, lipid, amino acid, protein, and purine metabolism. Although the exact mechanism of action by which niacin lowers cholesterol is not fully understood, it may act by inhibiting the synthesis of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), inhibiting the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, increasing lipoprotein lipase activity, and reducing the hepatic synthesis of VLDL-C and LDL-C.

vitamin B1	LFID:0000629	NCIT	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C874	A heat-labile and water-soluble essential vitamin, belonging to the vitamin B family, with antioxidant, erythropoietic, mood modulating, and glucose-regulating activities. Thiamine reacts with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form an active coenzyme, thiamine pyrophosphate. Thiamine pyrophosphate is necessary for the actions of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate in carbohydrate metabolism and for the actions of transketolase, an enzyme that plays an important role in the pentose phosphate pathway. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and may inhibit the action of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine may also protect against lead toxicity by inhibiting lead-induced lipid peroxidation.

intrauterine device	LFID:0000715	NCIT	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C42771	A device usually made of plastic or metal, inserted into the uterus to prevent conception. IUCD can be a coil, loop, triangle, or T in shape; its material can be impregnated with a pharmaceutical agent. The primary action of all IUCDs is the induction of a foreign-body reaction within the endometrium. This sterile inflammatory process is toxic to gametes, primarily spermatozoa, and effectively prevents viable sperm from passing into the fallopian tubes. The copper-bearing device has an independent toxic effect on spermatozoa. The progestin-releasing devices produce changes in endometrial architecture and function that reduce the potential for implantation of a fertilized egg. The progestin effect on the cervical mucus also reduces the penetrability of sperm.

It affects people with all levels of income and education.</p> <h3>What are the signs that someone is a victim of domestic violence?</h3> <p>If you think that a loved one might be the victim of domestic violence, learn about the different types of abuse and watch for these signs:</p> <p>Does your friend or loved one:</p><ul> <li>Have unexplained cuts or bruises?</li> <li>Avoid friends, family, and favorite activities?</li> <li>Make excuses for their partner's behavior?</li> <li>Look uncomfortable or fearful around their partner?</li> </ul> <p>Does your friend or loved one's partner:</p><ul> <li>Yell at or make fun of them?</li> <li>Try to control them by making all the decisions?</li> <li>Check up on them at work or school?</li> <li>Force them to do sexual things they don't want to do?</li> <li>Threaten to hurt himself or herself if the partner wants to break up?</li> </ul> <h3>What can I do if I am a victim of domestic violence?</h3> <p>Your safety is the most important concern. If you are in immediate danger, call 911.</p> <p>If you are not in immediate danger, you can:</p><ul> <li><strong>Get medical care</strong> if you have been injured or sexually assaulted</li> <li><strong>Call a helpline</strong> for free, anonymous help. You can contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233) or 800-787-3224 (TTY).<l i=""""> </l></li><li><strong>Find out where to get help in your community.</strong> Contact local organizations that can help you.</li> <li><strong>Make a safety plan to leave.</strong> Domestic violence usually does not get better. Think about a safe place for you to go and all of the things that you will need when you leave.</li> <li><strong>Save the evidence.</strong> Keep evidence of abuse, such as pictures of your injuries or threatening emails or texts. Make sure that it is in a safe place the abuser cannot access.</li> <li><strong>Talk to someone you trust</strong>, such as a family member, a friend, a co-worker, or a spiritual leader</li> <li><strong>Consider getting a restraining order</strong> to protect yourself</li> </ul> <h3>How can I help someone who is a victim of domestic violence?</h3> <p>Let your loved one know that being treated this way isn't healthy and that they are not to blame. You should:</p><ul> <li><strong>Call 911 if there is immediate danger</strong></li> <li><strong>Watch for the signs of abuse.</strong> Learn about the signs and keep track of the ones that you see.</li> <li><strong>Find out about local resources.</strong> Get the addresses and phone numbers of some local resources in your community. Then you'll be able to share the information if the person is ready for it.</li> <li><strong>Set up a time to talk.</strong> Make sure you can have your conversation in a safe, private place. Your loved one's partner may have access to his or her cell phone or computer, so be careful about sharing information over text or email.</li> <li><strong>Be specific about why you are worried.</strong> Describe the behaviors that concern you. Be as specific as possible when explaining why you are worried.</li> <li><strong>Plan for safety.</strong> If your loved one is ready to leave an abusive partner, help make a plan for getting out of the relationship as safely as possible. A domestic violence counselor can help with making a safety plan.</li> <li><strong>Be patient and do not judge.</strong> You should talk about your concerns with your loved one, but you need to understand that they may not be ready to talk about it. Let them know that you're available to talk at any time, and that you will listen without judging them.</li> </ul>"

The key chain-building reaction, a C-N bond-forming reaction, involves the generation of the characteristic peptide bond by nucleophilic attack of the amino group of an amino-acyl donor unit covalently bound to a downstream peptidyl carrier protein module (amino acyl-S-PCP) on the acyl group of an upstream electrophilic acyl- or peptidyl acyl-S-PCP chain, catalyzed by a condensation (C) domain. Supplementing these core chain-elongation domains are variable numbers of auxiliary domains that are responsible for modification of the growing polypeptide chain by a small set of iterated reactions including epimerization, N-methylation, and heterocyclization.

Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.

cognitive therapy	LFID:0002072	GSSO	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_011798	A type of psychotherapy developed by American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck. CT is one therapeutic approach within the larger group of cognitive and behavioral therapies and was first expounded by Beck in the 1960s. Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which states that thoughts, feelings and behavior are all connected, and that individuals can move toward overcoming difficulties and meeting their goals by identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behavior, and distressing emotional responses. This involves the individual working with the therapist to develop skills for testing and changing beliefs, identifying distorted thinking, relating to others in different ways, and changing behaviors.

Once within the cell, MDMA depletes stores of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) via acute oxidative inactivation; in turn, depleted stores of TPH leave cell terminals open to damage from oxidative stress, possibly a source of MDMA neurotoxicity. This agent also induces norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine release and can act directly on a number of receptors, including alpha 2-adrenergic and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptors. MDMA may suppress the dyskinesia associated with long-term use of L-dopamine (L-DOPA) without affecting the efficacy of L-DOPA treatment.

Oxycodone exerts its analgesic activity by binding to the mu-receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby mimicking the effects of endogenous opioids. Binding of the opiate receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby preventing cAMP production. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters, such as substance P, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, is inhibited. Oxycodone also inhibits the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. In addition, oxycodone closes N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and opens G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels resulting in hyperpolarization and reduction of neuronal excitability.

Hydromorphone selectively binds the mu-opioid receptor which is linked through G-proteins. Binding stimulates the exchange of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on the G-protein complex and interacts with and inhibits adenylate cyclase located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This leads to a reduction in intracellular cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Further, voltage-gated potassium channels are activated, thereby causing hyperpolarization and reducing neuronal excitability. In addition, the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels is inhibited, thereby leading to an inhibition of calcium entry and a reduction in the release of various neurotransmitters, including GABA, vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagons.

Complete dentures cover your entire upper or lower jaw. Partials replace one or a few teeth.</p> <p>Dentures may feel strange at first. Speaking and eating may feel different. Be careful when wearing dentures because they may make it harder for you to feel hot foods and liquids. Also, you may not notice biting on a bone from your food.</p> <p>In the beginning, your dentist may want to see you often to make sure the dentures fit. Over time, your mouth will change and you may need to have your dentures adjusted or replaced. Be sure to let your dentist handle these adjustments.</p> <p>If your dentures move too much in your mouth, denture adhesive may help. In some cases, your dentist may suggest that you switch to dental implants. They are permanent, and they replace both the roots and teeth.</p> <p>Keep your dentures clean and free from food that can cause stains, bad breath, or swollen gums. Brush them every day with a denture care product. Take your dentures out of your mouth at night, and put them in water or a denture-cleansing liquid.</p> <p class="""">NIH: National Institute on Aging</p>"

Scurvy grass, Scurvygrass, or Spoonwort) is a genus of about 30 species of annual and perennial herbs in the cabbage family *Brassicaceae*. They are widely distributed in temperate and arctic areas of the northern hemisphere, most commonly found in coastal regions, on cliff-tops and salt marshes where their high tolerance of salt enables them to avoid competition from larger, but less salt-tolerant plants; they also occur in alpine habitats in mountains and tundra.
 
Scurvy-grass was extensively eaten in the past by sailors suffering from scurvy after returning from long voyages, as the leaves are rich in vitamin C, which cures this deficiency disease resulting from a lack of fresh vegetables in the diet. The leaves, which have a strong peppery taste similar to the related horseradish and watercress, are also sometimes used in salads."

The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (*V. planifolia*), native to Mexico, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived. 
 The fruit is termed ""vanilla bean"", though true beans are fabaceaen eudicots not at all closely related to orchids. Rather, the vanilla fruit is technically an elongate, fleshy and later dehiscent capsule 10-20 cm long. It ripens gradually for 8 to 9 months after flowering, eventually turning black in color and giving off a strong aroma. Each pod contains thousands of minute seeds, and both the pods and seeds within are used to create vanilla flavoring. Vanilla beans are harvested by hand from commercial orchards.

diadromous fish	LFID:0004410	FOODON	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_03413360	Diadromous fish travel between salt and fresh water. Anadromous fish live in the sea mostly, breed in fresh water; the best-known are salmon, which hatch in small freshwater streams, go down to the sea and live there for several years, then return to the same streams where they were hatched, spawn, and die shortly thereafter. Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Catadromous fish live in fresh water, breed in the sea; the most remarkable are freshwater eels of genus Anguilla, whose larvae drift on the open ocean, sometimes for months or years, before travelling thousands of kilometres back to their original streams. Amphidromous fish move between fresh and salt water during some part of life cycle, but not for breeding.

silkworm	LFID:0004730	MESH	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D012831	A genus of silkworm MOTHS in the family Bombycidae of the order LEPIDOPTERA. The family contains a single species, Bombyx mori from the Greek for silkworm + mulberry tree (on which it feeds). A native of Asia, it is sometimes reared in this country. It has long been raised for its SILK and after centuries of domestication it probably does not exist in nature. It is used extensively in experimental GENETICS. (From Borror et al., An Introduction to the Study of Insects, 4th ed, p519)

mannitol	LFID:0005144	PDQ	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PDQ/CDR0000039493	"A naturally occurring alcohol found in fruits and vegetables and used as an osmotic diuretic. Mannitol is freely filtered by the glomerulus and poorly reabsorbed from the renal tubule, thereby causing an increase in osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate.

The generic name comes from the plant Calicotome villosa, aspalathos in Greek. This plant has very similar growth and flowers to the redbush. The specific name linearis comes from the plant's linear growing structure and needle-like leaves.

 The plant is used to make a herbal tea called rooibos tea, bush tea (esp. Southern Africa), redbush tea (esp. UK), South African red tea, or red tea. The product has been popular in Southern Africa for generations and is now consumed in many countries. It is sometimes spelled rooibosch in accordance with the old Dutch etymology."
